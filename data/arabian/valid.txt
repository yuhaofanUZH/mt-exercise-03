Praise be to God , the Lord of the two worlds , &#91; FN # 1 &#93; and blessing and peace upon the Prince of the Prophets , our lord and master Mohammed , whom God bless and preserve with abiding and continuing peace and blessing until the Day of the Faith !
Of a verity , the doings of the ancients become a lesson to those that follow after , so that men look upon the admonitory events that have happened to others and take warning , and come to the knowledge of what befell bygone peoples and are restrained thereby .
So glory be to Him who hath appointed the things that have been done aforetime for an example to those that come after !
And of these admonitory instances are the histories called the Thousand Nights and One Night , with all their store of illustrious fables and relations .
It is recorded in the chronicles of the things that have been done of time past that there lived once , in the olden days and in bygone ages and times , a king of the kings of the sons of Sasan , who reigned over the Islands &#91; FN # 2 &#93; of India and China and was lord of armies and guards and servants and retainers .
He had two sons , an elder and a younger , who were both valiant cavaliers , but the elder was a stouter horseman than the younger .
When their father died , he left his empire to his elder son , whose name was Shehriyar , and he took the government and ruled his subjects justly , so that the people of the country and of the empire loved him well , whilst his brother Shahzeman became King of Samarcand of Tartary .
The two kings abode each in his own dominions , ruling justly over their subjects and enjoying the utmost prosperity and happiness , for the space of twenty years , at the end of which time the elder king yearned after his brother and commanded his Vizier to repair to the latter &apos;s court and bring him to his own capital .
The Vizier replied , &quot; I hear and obey , &quot; and set out at once and journeyed till he reached King Shahzeman &apos;s court in safety , when he saluted him for his brother and informed him that the latter yearned after him and desired that he would pay him a visit , to which King Shahzeman consented gladly and made ready for the journey and appointed his Vizier to rule the country in his stead during his absence .
Then he caused his tents and camels and mules to be brought forth and encamped , with his guards and attendants , without the city , in readiness to set out next morning for his brother &apos;s kingdom .
In the middle of the night , it chanced that he bethought him of somewhat he had forgotten in his palace ; so he returned thither privily and entered his apartments , where he found his wife asleep in his own bed , in the arms of one of his black slaves .
When he saw this , the world grew black in his sight , and he said to himself , &quot; If this is what happens whilst I am yet under the city walls , what will be the condition of this accursed woman during my absence at my brother &apos;s court ? &quot;
Then he drew his sword and smote the twain and slew them and left them in the bed and returned presently to his camp , without telling any one what had happened .
Then he gave orders for immediate departure and set out a &apos;once and travelled till he drew near his brother &apos;s capital when he despatched vaunt-couriers to announce his approach .
His brother came forth to meet him and saluted him and rejoiced exceedingly and caused the city to be decorated in his honour .
Then he sat down with him to converse and make merry ; but King Shahzeman could not forget the perfidy of his wife and grief grew on him more and more and his colour changed and his body became weak .
Shehriyar saw his condition , but attributed it to his separation from his country and his kingdom , so let him alone and asked no questions of him , till one day he said to him , &quot; O my brother , I see that thou art grown weak of body and hast lost thy colour . &quot;
And Shahzeman answered , &quot; O my brother , I have an internal wound , &quot; but did not tell him about his wife .
Said Shehriyar , &quot; I wish thou wouldst ride forth with me a-hunting ; maybe it would lighten thy heart . &quot;
But Shahzeman refused ; so his brother went out to hunt without him .
Now there were in King Shahzeman &apos;s apartments lattice-windows overlooking his brother &apos;s garden , and as the former was sitting looking on the garden , behold a gate of the palace opened , and out came twenty damsels and twenty black slaves , and among them his brother &apos;s wife , who was wonderfully fair and beautiful .
They all came up to a fountain , where the girls and slaves took off their clothes and sat down together .
Then the queen called out , &quot; O Mesoud ! &quot;
And there came to her a black slave , who embraced her and she him .
Then he lay with her , and on likewise did the other slaves with the girls .
And they ceased not from kissing and clipping and cricketing and carousing until the day began to wane .
When the King of Tartary saw this , he said to himself , &quot; By Allah , my mischance was lighter than this ! &quot;
And his grief and chagrin relaxed from him and he said , &quot; This is more grievous than what happened to me ! &quot;
So he put away his melancholy and ate and drank .
Presently , his brother came back from hunting and they saluted each other : and Shehriyar looked at Shahzeman and saw that his colour had returned and his face was rosy and he ate heartily , whereas before he ate but little .
So he said to him , &quot; O my brother , when I last saw thee , thou wast pale and wan , and now I see that the colour has returned to thy face .
Tell me how it is with thee . &quot;
Quoth Shahzeman , &quot; I will tell thee what caused my loss of colour , but excuse me from acquainting thee with the cause of its return to me . &quot;
Said Shehriyar , &quot; Let me hear first what was the cause of thy pallor and weakness . &quot;
&quot; Know then , O my brother , &quot; rejoined Shahzeman , &quot; that when thou sentest thy vizier to bid me to thee , I made ready for the journey and had actually quitted my capital city , when I remembered that I had left behind me a certain jewel , that which I gave thee .
So I returned to my palace , where I found my wife asleep in my bed , in the arms of a black slave .
I slew them both and came to thee ; and it was for brooding over this affair , that I lost my colour and became weak .
But forgive me if I tell thee not the cause of my restoration to health . &quot;
When his brother heard this , he said to him , &quot; I conjure thee by Allah , tell me the reason of thy recovery ! &quot;
So he told him all that he had seen , and Shehriyar said , &quot; I must see this with my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; Then , &quot; replied Shahzeman , &quot; feign to go forth to hunt and hide thyself in my lodging and thou shalt see all this and have ocular proof of the truth . &quot;
So Shehriyar ordered his attendants to prepare to set out at once ; whereupon the troops encamped without the city and he himself went forth with them and sat in his pavilion , bidding his servants admit no one .
Then he disguised himself and returned secretly to King Shahzeman &apos;s palace and sat with him at the lattice overlooking the garden , until the damsels and their mistress came out with the slaves and did as his brother had reported , till the call to afternoon prayer .
When King Shehriyar saw this , he was as one distraught and said to his brother , &quot; Arise , let us depart hence , for we have no concern with kingship , and wander till we find one to whom the like has happened as to us , else our death were better than our life . &quot;
Then they went out by a postern of the palace and journeyed days and nights till they came to a tree standing in the midst of a meadow , by a spring of water , on the shore of the salt sea , and they drank of the stream and sat down by it to rest .
When the day was somewhat spent , behold , the sea became troubled and there rose from it a black column that ascended to the sky and made towards the meadow .
When the princes saw this , they were afraid and climbed up to the top of the tree , which was a high one , that they might see what was the matter ; and behold , it was a genie of lofty stature , broad-browed and wide-cheated , bearing on his head a coffer of glass with seven locks of steel .
He landed and sat down under the tree , where he set down the coffer , and opening it , took out a smaller one .
This also he opened , and there came forth a damsel slender of form and dazzlingly beautiful , as she were a shining sun , as says the poet Uteyeh : She shines out in the dusk , and lo !
the day is here , And all the trees flower forth with blossoms bright and clear , The sun from out her brows arises , and the moon , When she unveils her face , cloth hide for shame and fear .
All living things prostrate themselves before her feet , When she unshrouds and all her hidden charms appear ; And when she flashes forth the lightnings of her glance , She maketh eyes to rain , like showers , with many a tear .
When the genie saw her , he said to her , &quot; O queen of noble ladies , thou whom indeed I stole away on thy wedding night , I have a mind to sleep awhile . &quot;
And he laid his head on her knees and fell asleep .
Presently the lady raised her eyes to the tree and saw the two kings among the branches ; so she lifted the genie &apos;s head from her lap and laid it on the ground , then rose and stood beneath the tree and signed to them to descend , without heeding the Afrit .
&#91; FN # 3 &#93; They answered her , in the same manner , &quot; God on thee &#91; FN # 4 &#93; excuse us from this . &quot;
But she rejoined by signs , as who should say , &quot; If you do not come down , I will wake the Afrit on you , and he will kill you without mercy . &quot;
So they were afraid and came down to her , whereupon she came up to them and offered them her favours , saying , &quot; To it , both of you , and lustily ; or I will set the Afrit on you . &quot;
So for fear of him , King Shehriyar said to his brother Shahzeman , &quot; O brother , do as she bids thee . &quot;
But he replied , &quot; Not I ; do thou have at her first . &quot;
And they made signs to each other to pass first , till she said , &quot; Why do I see you make signs to each other ?
An you come not forward and fall to , I will rouse the Afrit on you . &quot;
So for fear of the genie , they lay with her one after the other , and when they had done , she bade them arise , and took out of her bosom a purse containing a necklace made of five hundred and seventy rings , and said to them , &quot; Know ye what these are ? &quot;
They answered , &quot; No . &quot;
And she said , &quot; Every one of the owners of these rings has had to do with me in despite of this Afrit .
And now give me your rings , both of you . &quot;
So each of them took off a ring and gave it to her .
And she said to them , &quot; Know that this genie carried me off on my wedding night and laid me in a box and shut the box up in a glass chest , on which he clapped seven strong locks and sank it to the bottom of the roaring stormy sea , knowing not that nothing can hinder a woman , when she desires aught , even as says one of the poets : I rede thee put no Faith in womankind , Nor trust the oaths they lavish all in vain : For on the satisfaction of their lusts Depend alike their love and their disdain .
They proffer lying love , but perfidy Is all indeed their garments do contain .
Take warning , then , by Joseph &apos;s history , And how a woman sought to do him bane ; And eke thy father Adam , by their fault To leave the groves of Paradise was fain .
Or as another says : Out on yon !
blame confirms the blamed one in his way .
My fault is not so great indeed as you would say .
If I &apos;m in love , forsooth , my case is but the same As that of other men before me , many a day .
For great the wonder were if any man alive From women and their wiles escape unharmed away ! &quot;
When the two kings heard this , they marvelled and said , &quot; Allah !
Allah !
There is no power and no virtue save in God the Most High , the Supreme !
We seek aid of God against the malice of women , for indeed their craft is great ! &quot;
Then she said to them , &quot; Go your ways . &quot;
So they returned to the road , and Shehriyar said to Shahzeman , &quot; By Allah , O my brother , this Afrit &apos;s case is more grievous than ours .
For this is a genie and stole away his mistress on her wedding night and clapped her in a chest , which he locked with seven locks and sank in the midst of the sea , thinking to guard her from that which was decreed by fate , yet have we seen that she has lain with five hundred and seventy men in his despite , and now with thee and me to boot .
Verily , this is a thing that never yet happened to any , and it should surely console us .
Let us therefore return to our kingdoms and resolve never again to take a woman to wife ; and as for me , I will show thee what I will do . &quot;
So they set out at once and presently came to the camp outside Shehriyar &apos;s capital and , entering the royal pavilion , sat down on their bed of estate .
Then the chamberlains and amirs and grandees came in to them and Shehriyar commanded them to return to the city .
So they returned to the city and Shehriyar went up to his palace , where he summoned his Vizier and bade him forthwith put his wife to death .
The Vizier accordingly took the queen and killed her , whilst Shehriyar , going into the slave girls and concubines , drew his sword and slew them all .
Then he let bring others in their stead and took an oath that every night he would go in to a maid and in the morning put her to death , for that there was not one chaste woman on the face of the earth .
As for Shahzeman , he sought to return to his kingdom at once ; so his brother equipped him for the journey and he set out and fared on till he came to his own dominions .
Meanwhile , King Shehriyar commanded his Vizier to bring him the bride of the night , that he might go in to her ; so he brought him one of the daughters of the amirs and he went in to her , and on the morrow he bade the Vizier cut off her head .
The Vizier dared not disobey the King &apos;s commandment , so he put her to death and brought him another girl , of the daughters of the notables of the land .
The King went in to her also , and on the morrow he bade the Vizier kill her ; and he ceased not to do thus for three years , till the land was stripped of marriageable girls , and all the women and mothers and fathers wept and cried out against the King , cursing him and complaining to the Creator of heaven and earth and calling for succour upon Him who heareth prayer and answereth those that cry to Him ; and those that had daughters left fled with them , till at last there remained not a single girl in the city apt for marriage .
One day the King ordered the Vizier to bring him a maid as of wont ; so the Vizier went out and made search for a girl , but found not one and returned home troubled and careful for fear of the king &apos;s anger .
Now this Vizier had two daughters , the elder called Shehrzad and the younger Dunyazad , and the former had read many books and histories and chronicles of ancient kings and stories of people of old time ; it is said indeed that she had collected a thousand books of chronicles of past peoples and bygone kings and poets .
Moreover , she had read books of science and medicine ; her memory was stored with verses and stories and folk-lore and the sayings of kings and sages , and she was wise , witty , prudent and well-bred .
She said to her father , &quot; How comes it that I see thee troubled and oppressed with care and anxiety ?
Quoth one of the poets : &apos; Tell him that is of care oppressed , That grief shall not endure alway , But even as gladness fleeteth by , So sorrow too shall pass away . &apos; &quot;
When the Vizier heard his daughter &apos;s words , he told her his case , and she said , &quot; By Allah , O my father , marry me to this king , for either I will be the means of the deliverance of the daughters of the Muslims from slaughter or I will die and perish as others have perished . &quot;
&quot; For God &apos;s sake , &quot; answered the Vizier , &quot; do not thus adventure thy life ! &quot;
But she said , &quot; It must be so . &quot;
Whereupon her father was wroth with her and said to her , &quot; Fool that thou art , dost thou not know that the ignorant man who meddles in affairs falls into grievous peril , and that he who looks not to the issue of his actions finds no friend in time of evil fortune ?
As says the byword , &apos; I was sitting at my ease , but my officiousness would not let me rest . &apos;
And I fear lest there happen to thee what happened to the ox and the ass with the husbandman . &quot;
&quot; And what happened to them ? &quot;
asked she .
Quoth the Vizier , &quot; Know , O my daughter , that Story of the Ox &#91; FN # 5 &#93; and the Ass There was once a merchant who was rich in goods and cattle , and he had a wife and children and dwelt in the country and was skilled in husbandry .
Now God had gifted him to understand the speech of beasts and birds of every kind , but under pain of death if he divulged his gift to any one ; so he kept it secret for fear of death .
He had in his byre an ox and an ass , each tied up in his stall , hard by the other .
One day , as the merchant was sitting near at hand , he heard the ox say to the ass , &apos; I give thee joy , O Father Wakeful !
&#91; FN # 6 &#93; Thou enjoyest rest and attention and they keep thy stall always swept and sprinkled , and thine eating is sifted barley and thy drink fresh water , whilst I am always weary , for they take me in the middle of the night and gird the yoke on my neck and set me to plough and I toil without ceasing from break of morn till sunset .
I am forced to work more than my strength and suffer all kinds of indignities , such as blows and abuse , from the cruel ploughman ; and I return home at the end of the day , and indeed my sides are torn and my neck is flayed .
Then they shut me up in the cow-house and throw me beans and straw mixed with earth and husks , and I lie all night in dung and stale .
But thy place is always swept and sprinkled and thy manger clean and full of sweet hay and thou art always resting , except that , now and then , our master hath occasion to ride thee and returns speedily with thee ; and but for this thou art always resting and I toiling , and thou sleeping and I waking ; thou art full and I hungry and thou honoured and I despised . &apos;
&apos;O broadhead , &apos; answered the ass , &apos; he was in the right who dubbed thee ox &#91; FN # 7 &#93; , for thou art stupid in the extreme , nor is there in thee thought or craft but thou showest zeal and cost thine utmost endeavour before thy master and fearest and killest thyself for the benefit of another .
Thou goest forth at the time of morning prayer and returnest not till sundown and endurest all day all manner of afflictions , now blows now fatigue and now abuse .
When thou returnest , the ploughman ties thee to a stinking manger , and thou friskest and pawest the ground and buttest with thy horns and bellowest greatly , and they think thou art content .
No sooner have they thrown thee thy fodder than thou fallest on it greedily and hastenest to fill thy belly with it .
But if thou wilt follow my counsel , it will be the better for thee and thou wilt get twice as much rest as I.
When thou goest forth to the furrow and they lay the yoke on thy neck , lie down , and do not rise , even if they beat thee , or only rise and lie down again ; and when they bring thee home , fall prostrate on thy back and refuse thy fodder , when they throw it thee and feign to be sick .
Do this for a day or two and thou wilt have rest from toil and weariness . &apos;
The ox thanked the ass greatly for his advice and called down blessings on him ; and the merchant heard all that passed between them .
Next day the ploughman took the ox and yoked him to the plough and set him to work as usual .
The ox began to fall short in his work , and the ploughman beat him till he broke the yoke and fled , following out the ass &apos;s precepts ; but the man overtook him and beat him till he despaired of life .
Yet for all that , he did nothing but stand still and fall down till the evening .
Then the ploughman took him home and tied him in his stall ; but he withdrew from the manger and neither frisked nor stamped nor bellowed as usual , and the man wondered at this .
Then he brought him the beans and straw , but he smelt at them and left them and lay down at a distance and passed the night without eating .
Next morning , the ploughman came and found the straw and beans untouched and the ox lying on his back , with his stomach swollen and his legs in the air ; so he was concerned for him and said to himself , &apos; He has certainly fallen ill , and this is why he would not work yesterday . &apos;
Then he went to his master and told him that the ox was ill and would not touch his fodder .
Now the farmer knew what this meant , for that he had overheard the talk between the ox and the ass as before mentioned .
So he said , &apos; Take that knave of an ass and bind the yoke on his neck and harness him to the plough and try and make him do the ox &apos;s work . &apos;
So the ploughman took the ass and made him work all day beyond his strength to accomplish the ox &apos;s task ; and he beat him till his skin and ribs were sore and his neck flayed with the yoke .
When the evening came and the ass resumed home , he could hardly drag himself along .
But as for the ox , he had lain all day , resting , and had eaten his fodder cheerfully and with a good appetite ; and all day long he had called down blessings on the ass for his good counsel , not knowing what had befallen him on his account .
So when the night came and the ass returned to the stable , the ox arose and said to him , &apos; Mayst thou be gladdened with good news , O Father Wakeful !
Through thee , I have rested today and have eaten my food in peace and comfort . &apos;
The ass made him no answer , for rage and vexation and fatigue and the beating he had undergone ; but he said to himself , &apos; All this comes of my folly in giving another good advice ; as the saying goes , &quot; I was lying at full length , but my officiousness would not let me be . &quot;
But I will go about with him and return him to his place , else I shall perish . &apos;
Then he went to his manger weary , whilst the ox thanked him and blessed him .
&quot; And thou , O my daughter , &quot; said the Vizier , &quot; like the ass , wilt perish through thy lack of sense , so do thou oft quiet and cast not thyself into perdition ; indeed I give thee good counsel and am affectionately solicitous for thee . &quot;
&quot; O my father , &quot; answered she , &quot; nothing will serve me but I must go up to this king and become his wife . &quot;
Quoth he , &quot; An thou hold not thy peace and bide still , I will do with thee even as the merchant did with his wife . &quot;
&quot; And what was that ? &quot;
asked she .
&quot; Know , &quot; answered he , &quot; that the merchant and his wife and children came out on the terrace , it being a moonlit night and the moon at its full .
Now the terrace overlooked the byre ; and presently , as he sat , with his children playing before him , the merchant heard the ass say to the ox , &apos; Tell me , O Father Stupid , what dost thou mean to do tomorrow ? &apos;
&apos;What but that thou advisest me ? &apos;
answered the ox .
&apos;Thine advice was as good as could be and has gotten me complete rest , and I will not depart from it in the least ; so when they bring me my fodder , I will refuse it and feign sickness and swell out my belly . &apos;
The ass shook his head and said , &apos; Beware of doing that I &apos; &apos; Why ? &apos;
asked the ox , and the ass answered , &apos; Know that I heard our master say to the labourer , &quot; If the ox do not rise and eat his fodder today , send for the butcher to slaughter him , and give his flesh to the poor and make a rug of his skin . &quot;
And I fear for thee on account of this .
So take my advice , ere ill-hap betide thee , and when they bring thee the fodder , eat it and arise and bellow and paw the ground with thy feet , or our master will assuredly slaughter thee . &apos;
Whereupon the ox arose and bellowed and thanked the ass , and said , &apos; Tomorrow , I will go with them readily . &apos;
Then he ate up all his fodder , even to licking the manger with his tongue .
When the merchant heard this , he was amused at the ass &apos;s trick , and laughed , till he fell backward .
&apos;Why dost thou laugh ? &apos;
asked his wife ; and he said , &apos; I laughed at something that I saw and heard , but it is a secret and I cannot disclose it , or I shall die . &apos;
Quoth she , &apos; There is no help for it but thou must tell me the reason of thy laughter , though thou die for it . &apos;
&apos;I cannot reveal it , &apos; answered he , &apos; for fear of death . &apos;
&apos;It was at me thou didst laugh , &apos; said she , and ceased not to importune him till he was worn out and distracted .
So he assembled all his family and kinsfolk and summoned the Cadi and the witnesses , being minded to make his last dispositions and impart to her the secret and die , for indeed he loved her with a great love , and she was the daughter of his father &apos;s brother and the mother of his children .
Moreover , he sent for all her family and the neighbours , and when they were all assembled , he told them the state of the case and announced to them the approach of his last hour .
Then he gave his wife her portion and appointed guardians of his children and freed his slave girls and took leave of his people .
They all wept , and the Cadi and the witnesses wept also and went up to the wife and said to her , &apos; We conjure thee , by Allah , give up this matter , lest thy husband and the father of thy children die .
Did he not know that if he revealed the secret , he would surely die , he would have told thee . &apos;
But she replied , &apos; By Allah , I will not desist from him , till he tell me , though he die for it . &apos;
So they forbore to press her .
And all who were present wept sore , and there was a general mourning in the house .
Then the merchant rose and went to the cow-house , to make his ablutions and pray , intending after to return and disclose his secret and die .
Now he had a cock and fifty hens and a dog , and he heard the latter say in his lingo to the cock , &apos; How mean is thy wit , O cock !
May he be disappointed who reared thee !
Our master is in extremity and thou clappest thy wings and crowest and fliest from one hen &apos;s back to another &apos;s !
God confound thee !
Is this a time for sport and diversion ?
Art thou not ashamed of thyself ? &apos;
&apos;And what ails our master , O dog ? &apos;
asked the cock .
The dog told him what had happened and how the merchant &apos;s wife had importuned him , till he was about to tell her his secret and die , and the cock said , &apos; Then is our master little of wit and lacking in sense ; if he cannot manage his affairs with a single wife , his life is not worth prolonging .
See , I have fifty wives .
I content this one and anger that , stint one and feed another , and through my good governance they are all under my control .
Now , our master pretends to sense and accomplishments , and he has but one wife and yet knows not how to manage her . &apos;
Quoth the dog , &apos; What , then , should our master do ? &apos;
&apos;He should take a stick , &apos; replied the cock , &apos; and beat her soundly , till she says , &quot; I repent , O my lord !
I will never again ask a question as long as I live . &quot;
And when once he has done this , he will be free from care and enjoy life .
But he has neither sense nor judgment . &apos;
When the merchant heard what the cock said , he went to his wife ( after he had hidden a rattan in an empty store-room ) and said to her , &apos; Come with me into this room , that I may tell thee my secret and die and none see me . &apos;
So she entered gladly , thinking that he was about to tell her his secret , and he locked the door ; then he took the rattan and brought it down on her back and ribs and shoulders , saying , &apos; Wilt thou ask questions about what is none of thy business ? &apos;
He beat her till she was well-nigh senseless , and she cried out , &apos; By Allah , I will ask thee no more questions , and indeed I repent sincerely ! &apos;
And she kissed his hands and feet .
Then he unlocked the door and went out and told the company what had happened , whereat they rejoiced , and mourning was changed into joy and gladness .
So the merchant learnt good management from a cock , and he and his wife lived happily until death .
And thou , O my daughter , &quot; added the Vizier , &quot; except thou desist from this thing , I will do with thee even as the merchant did with his wife . &quot;
&quot; I will never desist , &quot; answered she , &quot; nor is it this story that can turn me from my purpose ; and an thou yield not to me , I will go up myself to the King and complain to him of thee , in that thou grudges the like of me to the like of him . &quot;
Quoth her father , &quot; Must it be so ? &quot;
And she answered &quot; Yes . &quot;
So being weary of striving with her and despairing of turning her from her purpose , he went up to King Shehriyar and kissing the earth before him , told him about his daughter and how she would have him give her to him that next night ; whereat the King marvelled and said to him , &quot; How is this ?
By Him who raised up the heavens , if thou bring her to me , I shall say to thee on the morrow , &apos; Take her and put her to death . &apos;
And if thou kill her not , I will kill thee without fail . &quot;
&quot; O king of the age , &quot; answered the Vizier , &quot; it is she who will have it so ; and I told her all this , but she will not hear me and insists upon passing this night with thy highness . &quot;
&quot; It is well , &quot; answered Shehriyar ; &quot; go and make her ready , and tonight bring her to me . &quot;
So the Vizier returned to his daughter and told her what had passed , saying , &quot; May God not bereave us of thee ! &quot;
But Shehrzad rejoiced with an exceeding joy and made ready all that she needed , and said to her sister Dunyazad , &quot; O my sister , note well what I shall enjoin thee .
When I go up to the Sultan , I will send after thee , and when thou comest to me and seest that the King has done his will of me , do thou say to me , &apos; O my sister , an thou be not asleep , tell us some of thy delightful stories , to pass away the watches of this our night . &apos;
Do this and ( God willing ) it shall be the means of my deliverance and of the ridding of the folk of this calamity , and by it I will turn the King from his custom . &quot;
Dunyazad answered , &quot; It is well . &quot;
And the Vizier carried Shehrzad to the King , who took her to his bed and fell to toying with her .
But she wept , and he said to her , &quot; Why dost thou weep ? &quot;
&quot; O king of the age , &quot; answered she , &quot; I have a young sister and I desire to take leave of her this night and that she may take leave of me before the morning . &quot;
So he sent for Dunyazad , and she waited till the Sultan had done his desire of her sister and they were all three awake , when she coughed and said , &quot; O my sister , an thou be not asleep , tell us one of thy pleasant stories , to beguile the watches of our night , and I will take leave of thee before the morning . &quot;
&quot; With all my heart , &quot; answered Shehrzad , &quot; if the good king give me leave . &quot;
The King being wakeful , was pleased to hear a story and said , &quot; Tell on . &quot;
Whereat she rejoiced greatly and said , &quot; It is related , O august king , that THE MERCHANT AND THE GENIE .
There was once a merchant , who had much substance and traded largely in foreign countries .
One day , as he was riding through a certain country , whither he had gone to collect what was due to him , there overtook him the heat of the day and presently he espied a garden &#91; FN # 8 &#93; before him ; so he made towards it for shelter and alighting , sat down under a walnut tree , by a spring of water .
Then he put his hand to his saddle bags and took out a cake of bread and a date and ate them and threw away the date stone , when behold , there started up before him a gigantic Afrit , with a naked sword in his hand , who came up to him and said , &apos; Arise , that I may slay thee , even as thou hast slain my son . &apos;
&apos;How did I slay thy son ? &apos;
asked the merchant , and the genie replied , &apos; When thou threwest away the date stone , it smote my son , who was passing at the time , on the breast , and he died forthright . &apos;
When the merchant heard this , he said , &apos; Verily we are God &apos;s and to Him we return !
There is no power and no virtue but in God , the Most High , the Supreme !
If I killed him , it was by misadventure , and I prithee pardon me . &apos;
But the genie said , &apos; There is no help for it but I must kill thee . &apos;
Then he seized him and throwing him down , raised his sword to strike him : whereupon the merchant wept and said , &apos; I commit my affair to God ! &apos;
and recited the following verses : Fate has two days , untroubled one , the other lowering , And life two parts , the one content , the other sorrowing .
Say unto him that taunteth us with fortune &apos;s perfidy , &apos; At whom but those whose heads are high doth Fate its arrows fling ? &apos;
If that the hands of Time have made their plaything of our life , Till for its long protracted kiss ill-hap upon us spring , Dost thou not see the hurricane , what time the wild winds blow , Smite down the stately trees alone and spare each lesser thing ?
Lo !
in the skies are many stars , no one can tell their tale , But to the sun and moon alone eclipse brings darkening .
The earth bears many a pleasant herb and many a plant and tree : But none is stoned save only those to which the fair fruit cling .
Look on the sea and how the waifs float up upon the foam , But in its deepest depths of blue the pearls have sojourning .
&apos;Cut short thy speech , &apos; said the genie , &apos; for , by Allah , there is no help for it but I must kill thee . &apos;
&apos;Know , O Afrit , &apos; replied the merchant , &apos; that I have a wife and children and much substance , and I owe debts and hold pledges : so let me return home and give every one his due , and I vow by all that is most sacred that I will return to thee at the end of the year , that thou mayest do with me as thou wilt , and God is witness of what I say . &apos;
The genie accepted his promise and released him , whereupon he returned to his dwelling-place and paid his debts and settled all his affairs .
Moreover , he told his wife and children what had happened and made his last dispositions , and tarried with his family till the end of the year .
Then he rose and made his ablutions &#91; FN # 9 &#93; and took his winding sheet under his arm and bidding his household and kinsfolk and neighbours farewell , set out , much against his will , to perform his promise to the genie ; whilst his family set up a great noise of crying and lamentation .
He journeyed on till he reached the garden , where he had met with the genie , on the first day of the new year , and there sat down to await his doom .
Presently , as he sat weeping over what had befallen him , there came up an old man , leading a gazelle by a chain , and saluted the merchant , saying , &apos; What ails thee to sit alone in this place , seeing that it is the resort of the Jinn ?
&apos; &#91; FN # 10 &#93; The merchant told him all that had befallen him with the Afrit , and he wondered and said , &apos; By Allah , O my brother , thy good faith is exemplary and thy story is a marvellous one !
If it were graven with needles on the corners of the eye , it would serve as a warning to those that can profit by example . &apos;
Then he sat down by his side , saying , &apos; By Allah , O my brother , I will not leave thee till I see what befalls thee with this Afrit . &apos;
So they sat conversing , and fear and terror got hold upon the merchant and trouble increased upon him , notwithstanding the old man &apos;s company .
Presently another old man came up , leading two black dogs , and saluting them , inquired why they sat in a place known to be haunted by Jinn , whereupon the merchant repeated his story to him .
He had not sat long with them when there came up a third old man leading a dappled she-mule , and after putting to them the same question and receiving a like answer , sat down with them to await the issue of the affair .
They had sat but a little while longer , when behold , there arose a cloud of dust and a great whirling column approached from the heart of the desert .
Then the dust lifted and discovered the genie , with a drawn sword in his hand and sparks of fire issuing from his eyes .
He came up to them and dragged the merchant from amongst them , saying , &apos; Rise , that I may slay thee as thou slewest my son , the darling of my heart ! &apos;
Whereupon the merchant wept and bewailed himself and the three old men joined their cries and lamentations to his .
Then came forward the first old man , he of the gazelle , and kissed the Afrit &apos;s hand and said to him , &apos; O genie and crown of the kings of the Jinn , if I relate to thee my history with this gazelle and it seem to thee wonderful , wilt thou grant me a third of this merchant &apos;s blood ? &apos;
&apos;Yes , O old man , &apos; answered the genie , &apos; if thou tell me thy story and I find it wonderful , I will remit to thee a third of his blood . &apos;
Then said the old man , &apos; Know , O Afrit , that The First Old Man &apos;s Story .
This gazelle is the daughter of my father &apos;s brother and my own flesh and blood .
I married her whilst she was yet of tender age and lived with her near thirty years , without being blessed with a child by her .
So I took me a concubine and had by her a son like the rising full moon , with eyes and eyebrows of perfect beauty ; and he grew up and flourished till he reached the age of fifteen , when I had occasion to journey to a certain city , and set out thither with great store of merchandise .
Now my wife had studied sorcery and magic from her youth : so , I being gone , she turned my son into a calf and his mother into a cow and delivered them both to the cowherd : and when , after a long absence , I returned from my journey and inquired after my son and his mother , my wife said to me , &quot; Thy slave died and her son ran away , whither I know not . &quot;
I abode for the space of a year , mournful-hearted and weeping-eyed , till the coming of the Greater Festival , when I sent to the herdsman and bade him bring me a fat cow for the purpose of sacrifice .
So he brought me the very cow into which my wife had changed my concubine by her art ; and I tucked up my skirts and taking the knife in my hand , went up to the cow to slaughter her ; but she lowed and moaned so piteously , that I was seized with wonder and compassion and held my hand from her and said to the herd , &quot; Bring me another cow . &quot;
&quot; Not so ! &quot;
cried my wife .
&quot; Slaughter this one , for we have no finer nor fatter . &quot;
So I went up to her again , but she cried out , and I left her and ordered the herdsman to kill her and skin her .
So he killed her and flayed her , but found on her neither fat nor flesh , only skin and bone .
Then I was sorry for having slain her , when repentance availed me not ; and I gave her to the herd and said to him , &quot; Bring me a fat calf . &quot;
So he brought me my son in the guise of a calf ; and when he saw me , he broke his halter and came up to me and fawned on me and moaned and wept , till I took pity on him and said to the man , &quot; Bring me a cow and let this calf go . &quot;
But my wife cried out at me and said , &quot; Not so : thou must sacrifice this calf and none other to-day : for it is a holy and a blessed day , on which it behoves us to offer up none but a good thing , and we have no calf fatter or finer than this one . &quot;
Quoth I , &quot; Look at the condition of the cow I slaughtered by thine order ; we were deceived in her , and now I will not be persuaded by thee to slay this calf this time . &quot;
&quot; By the great God , the Compassionate , the Merciful , &quot; answered she , &quot; thou must without fail sacrifice this calf on this holy day !
Else thou art no longer my husband nor am I thy wife . &quot;
When I heard this harsh speech from her , I went up to the calf , knowing not what she aimed at , and took the knife in my hand . &apos; &quot;
Here Shehrzad perceived the day and was silent ; and her sister said to her , &quot; What a charming and delightful story ! &quot;
Quoth Shehrzad , &quot; This is nothing to what I will tell thee to-morrow night , if the King let me live . &quot;
And the King said to himself , &quot; By Allah , I will not kill her , till I hear the rest of the story ! &quot;
So they lay together till morning , when the King went out to his hall of audience and the Vizier came in to him , with the winding-sheet under his arm .
Then the King ordered and appointed and deposed , without telling the Vizier aught of what had happened , much to the former &apos;s surprise , until the end of the day , when the Divan broke up and he retired to his apartments .
And when it was the second night Dunyazad said to her sister Shehrzad , &quot; O my sister , finish us thy story of the merchant and the genie . &quot;
&quot; With all my heart , &quot; answered she , &quot; if the King give me leave . &quot;
The king bade her &quot; Say on . &quot;
So she began as follows : &quot; It has reached me , O august king and wise governor , that the first old man continued his story as follows : &apos; O lord of the Kings of the Jinn , as I was about to kill the calf , my heart failed me and I said to the herdsman , &quot; Keep this calf with the rest of the cattle . &quot;
So he took it and went away .
Next day the herd came to me , as I was sitting by myself , and said to me , &quot; O my lord , I have that to tell thee will rejoice thee , and I claim a reward for good news . &quot;
Quoth I , &quot; It is well . &quot;
And he said , &quot; O merchant , I have a daughter , who learnt the art of magic in her youth from an old woman who lived with us , and yesterday , when I took home the calf that thou gavest me , she looked at it and veiled her face and fell a-weeping .
Then she laughed and said to me , &apos; O my father , am I become of so little account in thine eyes that thou bringest in to me strange men ? &apos;
&apos;Where are the strange men ? &apos;
asked I.
&apos;And why dost thou weep and laugh ? &apos;
Quoth she , &apos; The calf thou hast there is our master &apos;s son , who has been enchanted , as well as his mother , by his father &apos;s wife .
This is why I laughed : and I wept for his mother , because his father slaughtered her . &apos;
I wondered exceedingly at this and the day had no sooner broken than I came to tell thee . &quot;
When ( continued the old man ) I heard the herdsman &apos;s story , O genie , I went out with him , drunken without wine for stress of joy and gladness , and accompanied him to his house , where his daughter welcomed me and kissed my hand ; and the calf came up to me and fawned on me .
Said I to the girl , &quot; Is it true what I hear about this calf ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , O my lord , &quot; answered she , &quot; this is indeed thy son and the darling of thy heart . &quot;
So I said to her , &quot; O damsel , if thou wilt release him , all that is under thy father &apos;s hand of beasts and goods shall be thine ! &quot;
But she smiled and said , &quot; O my lord , I care not for wealth , but I will do what thou desirest upon two conditions , the first that thou marry me to this thy son , and the second that thou permit me to bewitch the sorceress and imprison her ( in the shape of a beast ) ; else I shall not be safe from her craft . &quot;
I answered , &quot; Besides what thou seekest , thou shalt have all that is under thy father &apos;s hand , and as to my wife , it shall be lawful to thee to shed her blood , if thou wilt . &quot;
When she heard this , she took a cup full of water , and conjured over it ; then sprinkled the calf with the water , saying , &quot; If thou be a calf by the creation of the Almighty , abide in that form and change not : but if thou be enchanted , return to thine original form , with the permission of God the Most High ! &quot;
With that he shook and became a man : and I fell upon him and said to him , &quot; For God &apos;s sake , tell me what my wife did with thee and thy mother . &quot;
So he told me what had befallen them and I said to him , &quot; O my son , God hath sent thee one to deliver and avenge thee . &quot;
Then I married him to the herdsman &apos;s daughter , and she transformed my wife into this gazelle , saying to me , &quot; I have given her this graceful form for thy sake , that thou mayest look on her without aversion . &quot;
She dwelt with us days and nights and nights and days , till God took her to Himself ; and after her death , my son set out on a journey to the land of Ind , which is this merchant &apos;s native country ; and after awhile , I took the gazelle and travelled with her from place to place , seeking news of my son , till chance led me to this garden , where I found this merchant sitting weeping ; and this is my story . &apos;
Quoth the genie , &apos; This is indeed a rare story , and I remit to thee a third part of his blood . &apos;
Then came forward the second old man , he of the two greyhounds , and said to the genie , &apos; I will tell thee my story with these two dogs , and if thou find it still rarer and more marvellous , do thou remit to me another third part of his blood .
Quoth the genie , &apos; I agree to this . &apos;
Then said the second old man , &apos; Know , O lord of the Kings of the Jinn , that The Second Old Man &apos;s Story .
These two dogs are my elder brothers .
Our father died and left us three thousand dinars , &#91; FN # 11 &#93; and I opened a shop that I might buy and sell therein , and my brothers did each the like .
But before long , my eldest brother sold his stock for a thousand dinars and bought goods and merchandise and setting out on his travels , was absent a whole year .
One day , as I was sitting in my shop , a beggar stopped before me and I said to him , &quot; God assist thee !
&quot; &#91; FN # 12 &#93; But he said to me , weeping , &quot; Dost thou not recognize me ? &quot;
I took note of him , and behold , it was my brother .
So I rose and welcomed him and made him sit down by me and inquired how he came in such a case : but he answered , &quot; Do not ask me : my wealth is wasted and fortune has turned her back on me . &quot;
Then I carried him to the bath and clad him in one of my own suits and took him to live with me .
Moreover , I cast up my accounts and found that I had made a thousand dinars profit , so that my capital was now two thousand dinars .
I divided this between my brother and myself , saying to him , &quot; Put it that thou hast never travelled nor been abroad . &quot;
He took it gladly and opened a shop with it .
Presently , my second brother arose like the first and sold his goods and all that belonged to him and determined to travel .
We would have dissuaded him , but he would not be dissuaded and bought merchandise with which he set out on his travels , and we saw no more of him for a whole year ; at the end of which time he came to us as had done his elder brother , and I said to him , &quot; O my brother , did I not counsel thee not to travel ? &quot;
And he wept and said , &quot; O my brother , it was decreed : and behold , I am poor , without a dirhem &#91; FN # 13 &#93; or a shirt to my back . &quot;
Then I carried him to the bath and clad him in a new suit of my own and brought him back to my shop , where we ate and drank together ; after which , I said to him , &quot; O my brother , I will make up the accounts of my shop , as is my wont once a year , and the increase shall be between thee and me . &quot;
So I arose and took stock and found I was worth two thousand dinars increase , in excess of capital , wherefore I praised the Divine Creator and gave my brother a thousand dinars , with which he opened a shop .
In this situation we remained for some time , till one day , my brothers came to me and would have me go on a voyage with them ; but I refused and said to them , &quot; What did your travels profit you , that I should look to profit by the same venture ? &quot;
And I would not listen to them ; so we abode in our shops , buying and selling , and every year they pressed me to travel , and I declined , until six years had elapsed .
At last I yielded to their wishes and said to them , &quot; O my brothers , I will make a voyage with you , but first let me see what you are worth . &quot;
So I looked into their affairs and found they had nothing left , having wasted all their substance in eating and drinking and merrymaking .
However , I said not a word of reproach to them , but sold my stock and got in all I had and found I was worth six thousand dinars .
So I rejoiced and divided the sum into two equal parts and said to my brothers , &quot; These three thousand dinars are for you and me to trade with . &quot;
The other three thousand I buried , in case what befell them should befall me also , so that we might still have , on our return , wherewithal to open our shops again .
They were content and I gave them each a thousand dinars and kept the like myself .
Then we provided ourselves with the necessary merchandise and equipped ourselves for travel and chartered a ship , which we freighted with our goods .
After a month &apos;s voyage , we came to a city , in which we sold our goods at a profit of ten dinars on every one ( of prime cost ) .
And as we were about to take ship again , we found on the beach a damsel in tattered clothes , who kissed my hand and said to me , &quot; O my lord , is there in thee kindness and charity ?
I will requite thee for them . &quot;
Quoth I , &quot; Indeed I love to do courtesy and charity , though I be not requited . &quot;
And she said , &quot; O my lord , I beg thee to marry me and clothe me and take me back to thy country , for I give myself to thee .
Entreat me courteously , for indeed I am of those whom it behoves to use with kindness and consideration ; and I will requite thee therefor : do not let my condition prejudice thee . &quot;
When I heard what she said , my heart inclined to her , that what God ( to whom belong might and majesty ) willed might come to pass .
So I carried her with me and clothed her and spread her a goodly bed in the ship and went in to her and made much of her .
Then we set sail again and indeed my heart clove to her with a great love and I left her not night nor day and occupied myself with her to the exclusion of my brothers .
Wherefore they were jealous of me and envied me my much substance ; and they looked upon it with covetous eyes and took counsel together to kill me and to take my goods , saying , &quot; Let us kill our brother , and all will be ours . &quot;
And Satan made this to seem good in their eyes .
So they took me sleeping beside my wife and lifted us both up and threw us into the sea .
When my wife awoke , she shook herself and becoming an Afriteh , &#91; FN # 14 &#93; took me up and carried me to an island , where she left me for awhile .
In the morning , she returned and said to me , &quot; I have paid thee my debt , for it is I who bore thee up out of the sea and saved thee from death , by permission of God the Most High .
Know that I am of the Jinn who believe in God and His Apostle ( whom God bless and preserve ! )
and I saw thee and loved thee for God &apos;s sake .
So I came to thee in the plight thou knowest of and thou didst marry me , and now I have saved thee from drowning .
But I am wroth with thy brothers , and needs must I kill them . &quot;
When I heard her words , I wondered and thanked her for what she had done and begged her not to kill my brothers .
Then I told her all that had passed between us , and she said , &quot; This very night will I fly to them and sink their ship and make an end of them . &quot;
&quot; God on thee , &quot; answered I , &quot; do not do this , for the proverb says , &apos; O thou who dost good to those who do evil , let his deeds suffice the evil doer ! &apos;
After all , they are my brothers . &quot;
Quoth she , &quot; By Allah , I must kill them . &quot;
And I besought her till she lifted me up and flying away with me , set me down on the roof of my own house , where she left me .
I went down and unlocked the doors and brought out what I had hidden under the earth and opened my shop , after I had saluted the folk and bought goods .
At nightfall , I returned home and found these two dogs tied up in the courtyard : and when they saw me , they came up to me and wept and fawned on me .
At the same moment , my wife presented herself and said to me , &quot; These are thy brothers . &quot;
&quot; Who has done this thing unto them ? &quot;
asked I ; and she answered , &quot; I sent to my sister , who turned them into this form , and they shall not be delivered from the enchantment till after ten years . &quot;
Then she left me , after telling me where to find her ; and now , the ten years having expired , I was carrying the dogs to her , that she might release them , when I fell in with this merchant , who acquainted me with what had befallen him .
So I determined not to leave him , till I saw what passed between thee and him : and this is my story . &apos;
&apos;This is indeed a rare story , &apos; said the genie , &apos; and I remit to thee a third part of his blood and his crime . &apos;
Then came forward the third old man , he of the mule , and said , &apos; O genie , I will tell thee a story still more astonishing than the two thou hast heard , and do thou remit to me the remainder of his blood and crime . &apos;
The genie replied , &apos; It is well . &apos;
So the third old man said , &apos; Know , O Sultan and Chief of the Jinn , that The Third Old Man &apos;s Story .
This mule was my wife .
Some time ago , I had occasion to travel and was absent from her a whole year ; at the end of which time I returned home by night and found my wife in bed with a black slave , talking and laughing and toying and kissing and dallying .
When she saw me , she made haste and took a mug of water and muttered over it ; then came up to me and sprinkled me with the water , saying , &quot; Leave this form for that of a dog ! &quot;
And immediately I became a dog .
She drove me from the house , and I went out of the door and ceased not running till I came to a butcher &apos;s shop , where I stopped and began to eat the bones .
The butcher took me and carried me into his house ; but when his daughter saw me , she veiled her face and said to her father , &quot; How is it that thou bringest a man in to me ? &quot;
&quot; Where is the man ? &quot;
asked he ; and she replied , &quot; This dog is a man , whose wife has enchanted him , and I can release him . &quot;
When her father heard this , he said , &quot; I conjure thee by Allah , O my daughter , release him ! &quot;
So she took a mug of water and muttered over it , then sprinkled a little of it on me , saying , &quot; Leave this shape and return to thy former one . &quot;
And immediately I became a man again and kissed her hand and begged her to enchant my wife as she had enchanted me .
So she gave me a little of the water and said to me , &quot; When thou seest her asleep , sprinkle her with this water and repeat the words thou hast heard me use , naming the shape thou wouldst have her take , and she will become whatever thou wishest . &quot;
So I took the water and returned home and went in to my wife .
I found her asleep and sprinkled the water upon her , saying , &quot; Quit this form for that of a mule . &quot;
And she at once became a mule ; and this is she whom thou seest before thee , O Sultan and Chief of the Kings of the Jinn ! &apos;
Then he said to the mule , &apos; Is it true ? &apos;
And she nodded her head and made signs as who should say , &apos; Yes , indeed : this is my history and what befell me . &apos; &quot;
Here Shehrzad perceived the day and was silent .
And Dunyazad said to her , &quot; O my sister , what a delightful story is this of thine ! &quot;
&quot; This is nothing , &quot; answered Shehrzad , &quot; to what I will tell thee to-morrow night , if the King let me live . &quot;
Quoth the King to himself , &quot; By Allah , I will not put her to death till I hear the rest of her story , for it is wonderful . &quot;
And they lay together till the morning .
Then the King rose and betook himself to his audience-chamber , and the Vizier and the troops presented themselves and the Court was full .
The King judged and appointed and deposed and ordered and forbade till the end of the day , when the Divan broke up and he returned to his apartments .
And when it was the third night and the King had taken his will of the Vizier &apos;s daughter , Dunyazad said to her sister , &quot; O my sister , finish us thy story . &quot;
&quot; With all my heart , &quot; answered Shehrzad .
&quot; Know , O august King , that when the genie heard the third old man &apos;s story , he marvelled exceedingly and shook with delight and said , &apos; I remit to thee the remainder of his crime . &apos;
Then he released the merchant , who went up to the three old men and thanked them ; and they gave him joy of his escape and returned , each to his own country .
Nor is this more wonderful than the story of the Fisherman and the Genie . &quot;
&quot; What is that ? &quot;
asked the King : and she said , &quot; I have heard tell , O august King , that THE FISHERMAN AND THE GENIE .
There was once a poor fisherman , who was getting on in years and had a wife and three children ; and it was his custom every day to cast his net four times and no more .
One day he went out at the hour of noon and repaired to the sea-shore , where he set down his basket and tucked up his skirts and plunging into the sea , cast his net and waited till it had settled down in the water .
Then he gathered the cords in his hand and found it heavy and pulled at it , but could not bring it up .
So he carried the end of the cords ashore and drove in a stake , to which he made them fast .
Then he stripped and diving round the net , tugged at it till he brought it ashore .
Whereat he rejoiced and landing , put on his clothes ; but when he came to examine the net , he found in it a dead ass ; and the net was torn .
When he saw this , he was vexed and said : &apos; There is no power and no virtue save in God the Most High , the Supreme !
This is indeed strange luck ! &apos;
And he repeated the following verses : O thou that strivest in the gloom of darkness and distress , Cut short thine efforts , for in strife alone lies not success !
Seest not the fisherman that seeks his living in the sea , Midmost the network of the stars that round about him press !
Up to his midst he plunges in : the billows buffet him ; But from the bellying net his eyes cease not in watchfulness ; Till when , contented with his night , he carries home a fish , Whose throat the hand of Death hath slit with trident pitiless , Comes one who buys his prey of him , one who has passed the night , Safe from the cold , in all delight of peace and blessedness .
Praise be to God who gives to this and cloth to that deny !
Some fish , and others eat the fish caught with such toil and stress .
Then he said , &apos; Courage !
I shall have better luck next time , please God ! &apos;
And repeated the following verses : If misfortune assail thee , clothe thyself thereagainst With patience , the part of the noble : &apos; twere wiselier done .
Complain not to men : that were indeed to complain , To those that have no mercy , of the Merciful One .
So saying , he threw out the dead ass and wrung the net and spread it out .
Then he went down into the sea and cast again , saying , &apos; In the name of God ! &apos;
and waited till the net had settled down in the water , when he pulled the cords and finding it was heavy and resisted more than before , thought it was full of fish .
So he made it fast to the shore and stripped and dived into the water round the net , till he got it free .
Then he hauled at it till he brought it ashore , but found in it nothing but a great jar full of sand and mud .
When he saw this , he groaned aloud and repeated the following verses : Anger of Fate , have pity and forbear , Or at the least hold back thy hand and spare !
I sally forth to seek my daily bread And find my living vanished into air .
How many a fool &apos;s exalted to the stars , Whilst sages hidden in the mire must fare !
Then he threw out the jar and wrung out and cleansed his net : after which he asked pardon of God the Most High &#91; FN # 15 &#93; and returning to the sea a third time , cast the net .
He waited till it had settled down , then pulled it up and found in it potsherds and bones and broken bottles : whereat he was exceeding wroth and wept and recited the following verses : Fortune &apos;s with God : thou mayst not win to bind or set it free : Nor letter-lore nor any skill can bring good hap to thee .
Fortune , indeed , and benefits by Fate are lotted out : One country &apos;s blest with fertile fields , whilst others sterile be .
The shifts of evil chance cast down full many a man of worth And those , that merit not , uplift to be of high degree .
So come to me , O Death !
for life is worthless verily ; When falcons humbled to the dust and geese on high we see .
&apos;Tis little wonder if thou find the noble-minded poor , What while the loser by main force usurps his sovranty .
One bird will traverse all the earth and fly from East to West : Another hath his every wish although no step stir he .
Then he lifted his eyes to heaven and said , &apos; O my God , Thou knowest that I cast my net but four times a day ; and now I have cast it three times and have taken nothing .
Grant me then , O my God , my daily bread this time ! &apos;
So he said , &apos; In the name of God ! &apos;
and cast his net and waited till it had settled down in the water , then pulled it , but could not bring it up , for it was caught in the bottom Whereupon , &apos; There is no power and no virtue but in God ! &apos;
said he and repeated the following verses : Away with the world , if it be like this , away !
My part in it &apos;s nought but misery and dismay !
Though the life of a man in the morning be serene , He must drink of the cup of woe ere ended day .
And yet if one asked , &apos; Who &apos;s the happiest man alive ? &apos;
The people would point to me and &apos; He &apos; would say .
Then he stripped and dived down to the net and strove with it till he brought it to shore , where he opened it and found in it a brazen vessel , full and stoppered with lead , on which was impressed the seal of our lord Solomon , son of David ( on whom be peace ! ) .
When he saw this , he was glad and said , &apos; I will sell this in the copper market , for it is worth half a score diners . &apos;
Then he shook it and found it heavy and said to himself , &apos; I wonder what is inside !
I will open it and see what is in it , before I sell it . &apos;
So he took out a knife and worked at the leaden seal , till he extracted it from the vessel and laid it aside .
Then he turned the vase mouth downward and shook it , to turn out its contents ; but nothing came out , and he wondered greatly and laid it on the ground .
Presently , there issued from it a smoke , which rose up towards the sky and passed over the face of the earth ; then gathered itself together and condensed and quivered and became an Afrit , whose head was in the clouds and his feet in the dust .
His head was like a dome , his hands like pitchforks , his legs like masts , his mouth like a cavern , his teeth like rocks , his nostrils like trumpets , his eyes like lamps , and he was stern and lowering of aspect .
When the fisherman saw the Afrit , he trembled in every limb ; his teeth chattered and his spittle dried up and he knew not what to do .
When the Afrit saw him , he said , &apos; There is no god but God , and Solomon is His prophet !
O prophet of God , do not kill me , for I will never again disobey thee or cross thee , either in word or deed ! &apos;
Quoth the fisherman , &apos; O Marid , &#91; FN # 16 &#93; thou sayest , &quot; Solomon is the prophet of God . &quot;
Solomon is dead these eighteen hundred years , and we are now at the end of time .
But what is thy history and how comest thou in this vessel ? &apos;
When the Marid heard this , he said , &apos; There is no god but God !
I have news for thee , O fisherman ! &apos;
&apos;What news ? &apos;
asked he , and the Afrit answered , &apos; Even that I am about to slay thee without mercy . &apos;
&apos;O chief of the Afrits , &apos; said the fisherman , &apos; thou meritest the withdrawal of God &apos;s protection from thee for saying this !
Why wilt thou kill me and what calls for my death ?
Did I not deliver thee from the abysses of the sea and bring thee to land and release thee from the vase ? &apos;
Quoth the Afrit , &apos; Choose what manner of death thou wilt die and how thou wilt be killed . &apos;
&apos;What is my crime ? &apos;
asked the fisherman .
&apos;Is this my reward for setting thee free ? &apos;
The Afrit answered , &apos; Hear my story , O fisherman ! &apos;
&apos;Say on and be brief , &apos; quoth he , &apos; for my heart is in my mouth . &apos;
Then said the Afrit , &apos; Know , O fisherman , that I was of the schismatic Jinn and rebelled against Solomon son of David ( on whom be peace !
) , I and Sekhr the genie ; and he sent his Vizier Asef teen Berkhiya , who took me by force and bound me and carried me , in despite of myself , before Solomon , who invoked God &apos;s aid against me and exhorted me to embrace the Faith &#91; FN # 17 &#93; and submit to his authority : but I refused .
Then he sent for this vessel and shut me up in it and stoppered it with lead and sealed it with the Most High Name and commanded the Jinn to take me and throw me into the midst of the sea .
There I remained a hundred years , and I said in my heart , &quot; Whoso releaseth me , I will make him rich for ever . &quot;
But the hundred years passed and no one came to release me , and I entered on another century and said , &quot; Whoso releaseth me , I will open to him the treasures of the earth &quot; But none released me , and other four hundred years passed over me , and I said , &quot; Whoso releaseth me , I will grant him three wishes . &quot;
But no one set me free .
Then I was exceeding wroth and said to myself , &quot; Henceforth , whoso releaseth me , I will kill him and let him choose what death he will die . &quot;
And now , thou hast released me , and I give thee thy choice of deaths . &apos;
When the fisherman heard this , he exclaimed , &apos; O God , the pity of it that I should not have come to release thee till now ! &apos;
Then he said to the Afrit , &apos; Spare me , that God may spare thee , and do not destroy me , lest God set over thee one who will destroy thee . &apos;
But he answered , &apos; There is no help for it , I must kill thee : so choose what death thou wilt die . &apos;
The fisherman again returned to the charge , saying , &apos; Spare me for that I set thee free . &apos;
&apos;Did I not tell thee , &apos; replied the Marid , &apos; that is why I kill thee ? &apos;
&apos;O head of the Afrits , &apos; said the fisherman , &apos; I did thee a kindness , and thou repayest me with evil : indeed the proverb lieth not that saith : &quot; We did them good , and they the contrary returned : And this , upon my life , is what the wicked do !
Who helps those , that deserve it not , shall be repaid As the hyæna paid the man that helped her through . &quot; &apos;
&apos;Make no more words about it , &apos; said the Afrit ; &apos; thou must die . &apos;
Quoth the fisherman to himself , &apos; This is a genie , and I am a man ; and God hath given me a good wit .
So I will contrive for his destruction by my wit and cunning , even as he plotted mine of his craft and perfidy . &apos;
Then he said to the Afrit , &apos; Is there no help for it , but thou must kill me ? &apos;
He answered , &apos; No , &apos; and the fisherman said , &apos; I conjure thee , by the Most High Name graven upon the ring of Solomon son of David ( on whom be peace !
) , answer me one question truly . &apos;
When the Afrit heard him mention the Most High Name , he was agitated and trembled and replied , &apos; It is well : ask and be brief . &apos;
Quoth the fisherman , &apos; This vessel would not suffice for thy hand or thy foot : so how could it hold the whole of thee ? &apos;
Said the Afrit , &apos; Dost thou doubt that I was in it ? &apos;
&apos;Yes , &apos; answered the fisherman ; &apos; nor will I believe it till I see it with my own eyes . &apos; &quot;
Here Shehrzad perceived the day and was silent .
And when it was the fourth night &#91; FN # 18 &#93; Dunyazad said to her sister , &quot; O sister , an thou be not asleep , finish us thy story . &quot;
So Shehrzad began , &quot; I have heard tell , O august King , that , when he heard what the fisherman said , the Afrit shook and became a smoke over the sea , which drew together and entered the vessel little by little , till it was all inside .
Whereupon the fisherman made haste to take the leaden stopper and clapping it on the mouth of the vessel , called out to the Afrit , saying , &apos; Choose what death thou wilt die !
By Allah , I will throw thee back into the sea and build myself a house hard by , and all who come hither I will warn against fishing here , and say to them , &quot; There is an Afrit in these waters , that gives those who pull him out their choice of deaths and how he shall kill them . &quot; &apos;
When the Afrit heard this and found himself shut up in the vessel , he knew that the fisherman had outwitted him and strove to get out , but could not , for Solomon &apos;s seal prevented him ; so he said to the fisherman , &apos; I did but jest with thee . &apos;
&apos;Thou liest , O vilest and meanest and foulest of Afrits ! &apos;
answered he , and rolled the vessel to the brink of the sea ; which when the Afrit felt , he cried out , &apos; No !
No ! &apos;
And the fisherman said , &apos; Yes !
Yes ! &apos;
Then the Afrit made his voice small and humbled himself and said , &apos; What wilt thou do with me , O fisherman ? &apos;
&apos;I mean to throw thee back into the sea , &apos; replied he ; &apos; since thou hast lain there already eighteen hundred years , thou shalt lie there now till the hour of judgment .
Did I not say to thee , &quot; Spare me , so God may spare thee ; and do not kill me , lest God kill thee ? &quot;
but thou spurnedst my prayers and wouldst deal with me no otherwise than perfidiously .
So I used cunning with thee and now God has delivered thee into my hand . &apos;
Said the Afrit , &apos; Let me out , that I may confer benefits on thee . &apos;
The fisherman answered , &apos; Thou liest , O accursed one !
Thou and I are like King Younan &apos;s Vizier and the physician Douban . &apos;
&apos;Who are they , &apos; asked the Afrit , &apos; and what is their story ? &apos;
Then said the fisherman , &apos; Know , O Afrit , that Story of the Physician Douban .
There was once in a city of Persia a powerful and wealthy king , named Younan , who had guards and troops and auxiliaries of every kind : but he was afflicted with a leprosy , which defied the efforts of his physicians and wise men .
He took potions and powders and used ointments , but all to no avail , and not one of the doctors could cure him .
At last , there came to the King &apos;s capital city a great physician , stricken in years , whose name was Douban : and he had studied many books , Greek , ancient and modern , and Persian and Turkish and Arabic and Syriac and Hebrew , and was skilled in medicine and astrology , both theoretical and practical .
Moreover he was familiar with all plants and herbs and grasses , whether harmful or beneficial , and was versed in the learning of the philosophers ; in brief , he had made himself master of all sciences , medical and other .
He had not been long in the town before he heard of the leprosy with which God had afflicted the King , and of the failure of the physicians and men of science to cure him ; whereupon he passed the night in study ; and when the day broke and the morning appeared and shone , he donned his richest apparel and went in to the King and kissing the ground before him , wished him enduring honour and fair fortune , in the choicest words at his command .
Then he told him who he was and said to him , &quot; O King , I have learnt what has befallen thee in thy person and how a multitude of physicians have failed to find a means of ridding thee of it : but I will cure thee , O King , and that without giving thee to drink of medicine or anointing thee with ointment . &quot;
When the King heard this , he wondered and said to him , &quot; How wilt thou do this ?
By Allah , if thou cure me , I will enrich thee , even to thy children &apos;s children , and I will heap favours on thee , and whatever thou desirest shalt be shine , and thou shalt be my companion and my friend . &quot;
Then he gave him a dress of honour and made much of him , saying , &quot; Wilt thou indeed cure me without drugs or ointment ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , &quot; answered Douban , &quot; I will cure thee from without . &quot;
Whereat the King marvelled exceedingly and said , &quot; O physician , when wilt thou do as thou hast said ?
Make haste , O my son ! &quot;
Quoth Douban , &quot; I hear and obey : it shall be done tomorrow . &quot;
And he went down into the city and hired a house , in which he deposited his books and medicines .
Then he took certain drugs and simples and fashioned them into a mall , which he hollowed out and made thereto a handle and a ball , adapted to it by his art .
Next morning he presented himself before the King and kissing the ground before him , ordered him to repair to the tilting ground and play at mall there .
So the King mounted and repaired thither with his amirs and chamberlains and viziers , and hardly had he reached the appointed place when the physician Douban came up and presented him with the mall and ball he had prepared , saying , &quot; Take this mall and grip the handle thus and drive into the plain and stretch thyself well and strike this ball till thy hand and thy body sweat , when the drugs will penetrate thy hand and permeate thy body .
When thou hast done and the medicine has entered into thee , return to thy palace and enter the bath and wash . Then sleep awhile and thou wilt awake cured , and peace be on thee ! &quot;
The King took the mall and mounting a swift horse , threw the ball before him and drove after it with all his might and smote it : and his hand gripped the mall firmly .
And he ceased not to drive after the bail and strike it , till his hand and all his body sweated , and Douban knew that the drugs had taken effect upon him and ordered him to return and enter the bath at once .
So the King returned immediately and ordered the bath to be emptied for him .
They turned the people out of the bath , and his servants and attendants hastened thither and made him ready change of linen and all that was necessary : and he went in and washed himself well and put on his clothes .
Then he came out of the bath and went up to his palace and slept there .
When he awoke , he looked at his body and found it clean as virgin silver , having no trace left of the leprosy : whereat he rejoiced exceedingly and his breast expanded with gladness .
Next morning , he repaired to the Divan and sat down on his chair of estate , and the chamberlains and grandees attended on him .
Presently , the physician Douban presented himself and kissed the earth before the king and repeated the following verses : The virtues all exalted are , when thou art styled their sire : None else the title dares accept , of all that men admire .
Lord of the radiant brow , whose light dispels the mists of doubt From every goal of high emprize whereunto folk aspire , Ne &apos;er may thy visage cease to shine with glory and with joy , Although the face of Fate should gloom with unremitting ire !
Even as the clouds pour down their dews upon the thirsting hills , Thy grace pours favour on my head , outrunning my desire .
With liberal hand thou casteth forth thy bounties far and nigh , And so hast won those heights of fame thou soughtest to acquire .
The King rose to him in haste and embraced him and made him sit down and clad him in a splendid dress of honour .
Then tables of rich food were brought in , and Douban ate with the King and ceased not to bear him company all that day .
When it was night , the King gave him two thousand diners , besides other presents , and mounted him on his own horse ; and the physician returned to his lodging , leaving the King astonished at his skill and saying , &quot; This man cured me from without , without using ointments .
By Allah , this is none other than consummate skill !
And it behoves me to honour and reward him and make him my companion and bosom friend to the end of time . &quot;
The King passed the night in great content , rejoicing in the soundness of his body and his deliverance from his malady .
On the morrow , he went out and sat down on his throne ; and the grandees stood before him , whilst the amirs and viziers sat on his right hand and on his left .
Then he sent for the physician , who came and kissed the ground before him , whereupon the King rose to him and made him sit by his side and eat with him , and ceased not to converse with him and make much of him till night ; when he commanded five dresses of honour and a thousand diners to be given to him , and he returned to his house , well contented with the King .
Next morning , the King repaired as usual to his council-chamber , and the amirs and viziers and chamberlains took their places round him .
Now he had among his viziers one who was forbidding of aspect , sordid , avaricious and envious : a man of ill omen , naturally inclined to malevolence : and when he saw the esteem in which the King held Douban and the favours he bestowed on him , he envied him and plotted evil against him ; for , as says the byword , &quot; Nobody is free from envy &quot; --and again-- &quot; Tyranny is latent in the soul : weakness hides it and strength reveals it . &quot;
So he came to the King and kissed the earth before him and said to him &quot; O King of the age , thou in whose bounties I have grown up , I have a grave warning to give thee , which did I conceal from thee , I were a son of shame : wherefore , if thou command me to impart it to thee , I will do so . &quot;
Quoth the King ( and indeed the Vizier &apos;s words troubled him ) , &quot; What is thy warning ? &quot;
&quot; O illustrious King , &quot; answered the Vizier , &quot; the ancients have a saying , &apos; Whoso looks not to the issue of events , fortune is no friend of his : &apos; and indeed I see the King in other than the right way , in that he favours his enemy , who seeks the downfall of his kingdom , and makes much of him and honours him exceedingly and is beyond measure familiar with him : and of a truth I am fearful for the King . &quot;
Quoth King Younan ( and indeed he was troubled and his colour changed ) , &quot; Of whom dost thou speak ? &quot;
The Vizier answered , &quot; If thou sleepest , awake .
I mean the physician Douban . &quot;
&quot; Out on thee ! &quot;
said the King .
&quot; He is my true friend and the dearest of all men to me ; seeing that he medicined me by means of a thing I held in my hand and cured me of my leprosy , which the doctors were unable to cure ; and there is not his like to be found in this time , no , not in the whole world , East nor West ; and it is of him that thou speakest thus !
But from to-day I will assign him stipends and allowances and appoint him a thousand diners a month : and if I should share my kingdom with him , it were but a little thing .
Methinks thou sayest this out of pure envy and wouldst have me kill him and after repent , as King Sindbad repented the killing of his falcon . &quot;
&quot; Pardon me , O King of the age , &quot; said the Vizier , &quot; but how was that !
Quoth the King , &quot; It is said that King Sindbad and His Falcon .
There was once a King of Persia , who delighted in hunting ; and he had reared a falcon , that left him not day or night , but slept all night long , perched upon his hand .
Whenever he went out to hunt , he took the falcon with him ; and he let make for it a cup of gold to hang round its neck , that he might give it to drink therein .
One day , his chief falconer came in to him and said , &apos; O King , now is the time to go a-hunting . &apos;
So the King gave orders accordingly and took the falcon on his wrist and set out , accompanied by his officers and attendants .
They rode on till they reached a valley , where they formed the circle of the chase , and behold , a gazelle entered the ring ; whereupon quoth the King , &apos; Whoso lets the gazelle spring over his head , I will kill him . &apos;
Then they drew the ring closelier round her , and behold , she came to the King &apos;s station and standing still , put her forelegs to her breast , as if to kill the earth before him .
He bowed to her , but she sprang over his head and was off into the desert .
The King saw his attendants nodding and winking to one another about him and said to his Vizier , &apos; O Vizier , what say my men ? &apos;
&apos;They say , &apos; answered the Vizier , that thou didst threaten to kill him over whose head the gazelle should spring . &apos;
&apos;As my head liveth , &apos; rejoined the King , &apos; I will follow her up , till I bring her back ! &apos;
So he pricked on after her and followed her till he came to a mountain and she made for her lair ; but the King cast off the falcon , which swooped down on her and pecked at her eyes , till he blinded her and dazed her ; whereupon the King threw his mace at her and brought her down .
Then he alighted and cut her throat and skinned her and made her fast to his saddle-bow .
Now it was the hour of midday rest and the place , where he was , was desert , and the King was athirst and so was his horse .
So he searched till he saw a tree , with water dripping slowly , like oil , from its branches .
Now the King &apos;s hands were gloved with leather ; &#91; FN # 19 &#93; so he took the cup from the falcon &apos;s neck and filled it with the liquid and set it before himself , when behold , the falcon smote the cup and overturned it .
The King took it and refilled it with the falling drops and set it before the bird , thinking that it was athirst : but it smote it again and overturned it .
At this , the King was vexed with the falcon and rose and filled the cup a third time and set it before the horse : but the falcon again overturned it with its wing .
Then said the King , &apos; God confound thee , thou most mischievous of fowls , thou wilt neither drink thyself nor let me nor the horse drink ! &apos;
And he smote it with his sword and cut off its wings : whereupon it erected its head and made signs as who should say , &apos; Look what is at the top of the tree . &apos;
The King raised his eyes and saw at the top of the tree a brood of snakes , and this was their <unk> dripping , which he had taken for water .
So he repented him of having cut off the falcon &apos;s wings and mounting , rode on till he reached his tents and gave the gazelle to the cook to roast .
Then he sat down on his chair , with the falcon on his wrist : and presently the bird <unk> and died : whereupon the King cried out in sorrow and lament for having slain the bird that had saved him from death , and repented him when repentance availed him not .
This , then , is the story of King Sindbad ; and as for thee , O Vizier , envy hath entered into thee , and thou wouldst have me kill the physician and after repent , even as King Sindbad repented . &quot;
&quot; O mighty King , &quot; answered the Vizier , &quot; what harm has this physician done me that I should wish his death ?
Indeed I only do this thing in compassion for thee and that thou mayst know the truth of the matter : else may I perish as perished the Vizier who plotted to destroy the king his master &apos;s son . &quot;
&quot; How was that ?
asked the King , and the Vizier replied , &quot; Know , O King , that The King &apos;s Son and the Ogress .
There was once a King &apos;s son who was passionately fond of the chase ; and his father had charged one of his Viziers to attend him wherever he went .
One day , the prince went out to hunt , accompanied by the Vizier , and as they were going along , they saw a great wild beast , whereupon the Vizier said to the prince , &apos; Up and after yonder beast ! &apos;
So the prince rode after the beast and followed it , till he was lost to sight .
