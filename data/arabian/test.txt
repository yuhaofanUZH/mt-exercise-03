After awhile , the beast disappeared in the desert , and the prince found himself alone , not knowing which way to turn .
Presently he came upon a damsel , weeping , and said to her , &apos; Who art thou ? &apos;
Quoth she , &apos; I am the daughter of one of the Kings of India , and I was journeying through this country , with a company of people , when sleep overcame me and I fell from my horse , not knowing what I did .
My people did not note my fall and went on and left me ; and now I am alone and bewildered . &apos;
When the prince heard this , he had pity on her case and took her up behind himself and they rode on , till they came to some ruins ; when she said to him , &apos; O my lord , I wish to do an occasion here . &apos;
So he put her down , and she entered the ruins and tarried there till he became impatient and went in search of her ; when he was ware that she was an ogress , and heard her say to her children , &apos; O my children , I have brought you to day a fat youth . &apos;
&apos;O mother , &apos; answered they , &apos; bring him to us , that we may <unk> on him our bellyful . &apos;
When the prince heard this their talk , he trembled in every <unk> and made sure of destruction and turned back .
The ogress came out after him and finding him terrified and trembling , said to him , &apos; Why dost thou fear ? &apos;
Quoth he , &apos; I have an enemy , of whom I am in fear . &apos;
<unk> thou not say that thou wast a King &apos;s son ? &apos;
asked she , and he answered &apos; Yes . &apos;
&apos;Then , &apos; said she , &apos; why dost thou not give thine enemy money and so <unk> him ? &apos;
He replied , &apos; Indeed he will not be satisfied with money nor with aught but life ; and I fear him and am an oppressed man . &apos;
&apos;If thou be oppressed as thou sayst , &apos; rejoined she , &apos; ask help of God ; surely He will protect thee from thine enemy and from the mischief thou fearest from him . &apos;
So the prince raised his eyes to heaven and said , &apos; O Thou that <unk> the prayer of the distressed , when they call on Thee , and <unk> evil from them , O my God , succour me against mine enemy and turn him back from me , for Thou indeed canst do whatsoever Thou wilt . &apos;
When the ogress heard his prayer , she departed from him and he resumed to the King his father and informed him of the Vizier &apos;s conduct : whereupon the King sent for the latter and put him to death .
And thou , O King &quot; ( continued the envious Vizier ) , &quot; if thou put thy trust in this physician , he will kill thee in the foulest fashion .
He , verily , whom thou hast <unk> and admitted to thy friendship , <unk> thy destruction : for know that he is a spy come from a far land with intent to destroy thee .
Seest thou not that he cured thee of thy <unk> from without , by means of a thing held in thy hand , and how canst thou be sure that he will not kill thee by some like means ? &quot;
&quot; Thou speakest sooth , O Vizier of good counsel ! &quot;
said the King .
&quot; It must indeed be as thou sayst ; this physician doubtless comes as a spy , seeking to destroy me ; and indeed , if he could cure me by means of a handle held in my hand , he can kill me by means of something I shall smell .
But what is to be done with him ? &quot;
&quot; Send after him at once , &quot; answered the Vizier , &quot; and when he comes , strike off his head and play him false , ere he play thee false ; and so shalt thou ward off his mischief and be at peace from him . &quot;
&quot; Thou art right , O Vizier , &quot; rejoined the King and sent for the physician , who came , rejoicing , for he knew not what the Compassionate had decreed unto him .
As the saying runs : Thou that fearest ill fortune , be of good heart and hope !
Trust thine affairs to Him who fashioned the earth and sea !
What is decreed of God surely shall come to pass ; That which is not decreed never shall trouble thee .
When Douban entered , he recited the following verses : If all the thanks I speak come short of that which is your due , Say for whom else my verse and prose I make except for you ?
You have indeed prevented me with many an <unk> boon , Blest me , <unk> of excuse , with favours not a few .
How then should I omit to give your praise its full desert And celebrate with heart and voice your goodness ever new ?
I will indeed proclaim aloud the <unk> I owe to you , <unk> , that , heavy to the <unk> , are light the thought unto .
And also the following : <unk> thy face from trouble and from care And trust in God to order thine affair .
<unk> in happy fortune near at hand , In which thou shalt forget the woes that were .
Full many a weary and a troublous thing Is , in its issue , <unk> and fair .
God orders all according to His will : <unk> Him not in what He doth prepare .
And these also : Trust thine affairs to the <unk> , to God that knoweth all , And rest at peace from the world , for nothing shall thee <unk> .
Know that the things of the world not , as thou wilt , befall , But as the Great God orders , to whom all kings are thrall !
And <unk> these : Take heart and rejoice and forget thine every woe , For even the wit of the wise is eaten away by care .
What shall thought-taking profit a helpless , <unk> slave ?
Leave it and be at peace in joy enduring fore &apos;er !
When he had finished , the King said to him , &quot; Dost thou know why I have sent for thee ? &quot;
And the physician answered , &quot; None knoweth the hidden things save God the Most High . &quot;
Quoth the King , &quot; I have sent for thee to kill thee and put an end to thy life . &quot;
Douban wondered greatly at these words and said , &quot; O King , wherefore wilt thou kill me and what offence have I committed ? &quot;
&quot; I am told , &quot; replied Younan , &quot; that thou art a spy and comest to kill me , but I will kill thee first . &quot;
Then he cried out to his swordbearer , saying , &quot; Strike off the head of this <unk> and rid us of his mischief ! &quot;
&quot; Spare me , &quot; said Douban ; &quot; so may God spare thee ; and kill me not , lest God kill thee ! &quot;
And he repeated these words to him , even as I did to thee , O Afrit , and thou wouldst not spare me , but persistedst in thine intent to put me to death .
Then the King said to Douban , &quot; Verily I shall not be secure except I kill thee : for thou <unk> me by means of a handle I held in my hand , and I have no <unk> but thou wilt kill me by means of perfumes or otherwise . &quot;
&quot; O King , &quot; said Douban , &quot; is this my reward from thee ?
Thou returnest evil for good ? &quot;
The King replied , &quot; It boots not : thou must die and that without delay . &quot;
When the physician saw that the King was <unk> resolved to kill him , he wept and lamented the good he had done to the <unk> , blaming himself for having <unk> in an <unk> <unk> and repeating the following verses : <unk> has no wit to guide her by , Although her sire among the wise ranks high .
The man , who has no sense to rule his steps , <unk> , he the ground he <unk> on wet or dry .
Then the swordbearer came forward and bandaged his eyes and <unk> his sword , said to the King , &quot; Have I thy leave to strike ? &quot;
Whereupon the physician wept and said , &quot; Spare me , so God may spare thee : and kill me not , lest God kill thee ! &quot;
And he recited the following verses : I acted in good faith and they <unk> : I came to nought : They prospered , whilst my <unk> brought me to evil case .
If that I live , I will to none good counsel give again : And if I die , good <unk> be <unk> of every race !
And he said to the King , &quot; Is this my reward from thee ?
Thou givest me the crocodile &apos;s recompense . &quot;
Quoth the King , &quot; What is the story of the crocodile ? &quot;
&quot; I cannot tell it , &quot; answered Douban , &quot; and I in this case ; but , God on thee , spare me , so may He spare thee ! &quot;
And he wept sore .
Then one of the King &apos;s chief officers rose and said , &quot; O King , grant me this man &apos;s life , for we see not that he has committed any offence against thee nor that he has done aught but cure thee of thy disorder , which <unk> the doctors and sages . &quot;
&quot; Ye know not why I put him to death , &quot; answered the King : &quot; it is because I believe him to be a spy , who hath been <unk> to kill me and came hither with that intent : and verily he who cured me by means of a handle held in my hand can easily poison me in like manner .
If I spare him , he will <unk> destroy me : so needs must I kill him , and then I shall feel myself safe . &quot;
When the physician was convinced that there was no hope for him , but that the King would indeed put him to death , he said to the latter , &quot; O King , if thou must indeed kill me , grant me a respite , that I may go to my house and discharge my last duties and <unk> of my medical books and give my people and friends directions for my <unk> .
Among my books is one that is a <unk> of rarities , and I will make thee a present of it , that thou mayst lay it up in thy treasury . &quot;
&quot; And what is in this book ? &quot;
asked the King .
Quoth Douban , &quot; It contains things without number : the least of its secret virtues is that if , when thou hast cut off my head , thou open the book , turn over six leaves and read three lines of the <unk> page , my head will speak and answer whatever questions thou shalt ask it . &quot;
At this the King marvelled greatly and shook with delight and said , &quot; O physician , will thy head indeed speak to me , after it is cut off ? &quot;
And he answered , &quot; Yes , O King . &quot;
Quoth the King , &quot; This is indeed wonderful ! &quot;
And sent him under guard to his house , where Douban spent the remainder of the day in setting his affairs in order .
Next day , the amirs and viziers and chamberlains and all the great officers and notables of the kingdom came to the court , and the presence chamber was like a flower garden .
Presently the physician entered , bearing an old book and a small pot full of powder ; and sitting down , called for a dish .
So they brought him a dish , and he poured the powder therein and levelled it .
Then he said , &quot; O King , take this book , but do not open it till my head has been cut off , placed on this dish and pressed down on the powder , when the blood will cease to flow : then open the book and do as I have enjoined thee . &quot;
The King took the book and gave the signal to the headsman , who rose and struck off the physician &apos;s head and set it on the dish , pressing it down upon the powder , when the blood immediately ceased to flow , and the head <unk> its eyes and said , &quot; Open the book , O King ! &quot;
Younan opened the book and found the leaves stuck together ; so he put his finger to his mouth and took of his spittle and <unk> them therewith and turned over the pages in this manner , one after another , for the leaves would not come apart but with <unk> , till he came to the seventh page , but found nothing written thereon and said to the head , &quot; O physician , there is nothing here . &quot;
Quoth the head , &quot; Open more leaves . &quot;
So the King turned over more leaves in the same manner .
Now the book was as poisoned , and before long the poison began to work upon the King , and he fell back in <unk> and cried out , &quot; I am poisoned ! &quot;
Whereupon the head repeated the following verses : Lo , these once were kings who <unk> with a harsh and <unk> sway !
In a little , their <unk> was as if it ne &apos;er had been .
Had they swayed the <unk> justly , they had been repaid the like , But they were unjust , and Fortune <unk> them with dole and teen .
Now they &apos;re passed away , the <unk> of their case <unk> them thus , &quot; This is what your sins have <unk> you : Fate is not to blame , I <unk> . &quot;
No sooner had it done speaking , than the King fell down dead and the head also ceased to live .
And know , O Afrit ( continued the fisherman ) , that if King Younan had spared the physician Douban , God would have spared him ; but he refused and sought his death ; so God killed him .
And thou , O Afrit , if thou hadst spared me , I would spare thee ; but nothing would serve thee but thou must put me to death ; so now I will kill thee by shutting thee up in this vessel and throwing thee into the sea . &apos;
At this the Marid roared out and said , &apos; God on thee , O fisherman , do not do that !
Spare me and bear me not malice for what I did , for men &apos;s wit is still better than that of Jinn .
If I did evil , do thou good , in accordance with the <unk> , &quot; O thou that dost good to him that does evil , the deed of the evil-doer suffices him . &quot;
Do not thou deal with me as did Umameh with Aatikeh . &apos;
&apos;And what did Umameh with Aatikeh ? &apos;
asked the fisherman .
But the Afrit answered , &apos; This is no time to tell stories , and I in this duresse : let me out , and I will tell thee . &apos;
Quoth the fisherman , &apos; Leave this talk : I must and will throw thee into the sea , and thou shalt never win out again ; for I besought thee and humbled myself to thee , but nothing would serve thee but thou must kill me , who had committed no offence against thee deserving this nor done thee any ill , but only kindness , in that I delivered thee from duresse .
When thou didst thus by me , I knew thee for an <unk> evil-doer ; and know that , when I have thrown thee back into the sea , I will tell every one what happened between me and thee and warn him , to the end that whoever fishes thee up may throw thee in again ; and thou shalt remain in the sea till the end of time and suffer all manner of torments . &apos;
Quoth the Afrit , &apos; Let me out , for this is the season of generosity ; and I will make a compact with thee never to do thee hurt and to help thee to what shall enrich thee . &apos;
The fisherman accepted his proposal and <unk> the vessel , after he had taken the Afrit &apos;s pledge and made him swear by the Most High Name never to hurt him , but on the contrary to do him service .
Then the smoke ascended as before and gathered itself together and became an Afrit , who gave the vessel a kick and sent it into the sea .
When the fisherman saw this , he let fly in his clothes and gave himself up for lost , saying , &apos; This <unk> no good . &apos;
But he took courage and said to the Afrit , &apos; O Afrit , quoth God the Most High , &quot; Be ye faithful to your <unk> , for they shall be enquired of : &quot; and verily thou madest a <unk> with me and <unk> to me that thou wouldst do me no hurt .
So play me not false , lest God do the like with thee : for indeed He is a jealous God , who <unk> to punish , yet <unk> not the evil-doer escape .
And I say to thee , as said the physician Douban to King Younan , &quot; Spare me , so God may spare thee ! &quot; &apos;
The Afrit laughed and started off inland , saying to the fisherman , &apos; Follow me . &apos;
So he followed him , trembling and not believing that he should escape , and the Afrit led him to the backward of the town : then crossing a hill , descended into a spacious plain , in the midst of which was a lake of water surrounded by four little hills .
He led the fisherman into the midst of the lake , where he stood still and bade him throw his net and fish .
The fisherman looked into the water and was astonished to see therein fish of four colours , white and red and blue and yellow .
Then he took out his net and cast and drawing it in , found in it four fish , one of each colour .
At this he rejoiced , and the Afrit said to him , &apos; Carry them to the Sultan and present them to him , and he will give thee what shall enrich thee .
And accept my excuse , for I know not any other way to fulfil my <unk> <unk> to thee , having lain in yonder sea eighteen hundred years and never seen the surface of the earth till this time .
But do not fish here more than once a day ; and I commend thee to God &apos;s care ! &apos;
So saying , he struck the earth with his foot , and it opened and <unk> him up , whilst the fisherman returned , wondering at all that had befallen him , to his house , where he took a bowl of water and laid therein the fish , which began to <unk> about .
Then he set the bowl on his head and going up to the palace , as the Afrit had bidden him , presented the fish to the King , who wondered at them greatly , for that he had never seen their like , in shape or kind , and said to his Vizier , &apos; Give these fish to the cookmaid that the King of the Greeks sent us , and tell her to fry them . &apos;
Now this was a damsel that he had received as a present from the King of the Greeks three days before and of whom he had not yet made trial in cookery .
So the Vizier carried the fish to the cookmaid and said to her , &apos; These fish have been brought as a present to the Sultan and he says to thee , &quot; O my tear , I have <unk> thee against my stress ! &quot;
So do thou show us to-day thy skill and the excellence of thy cookery . &apos;
Then he returned to the Sultan , who bade him give the fisherman four hundred diners .
So he gave them to him and he took the money in his lap and set off home , running and <unk> and falling and rising again and thinking that he was dreaming .
And he bought what was needful for his family and returned to his wife , glad and happy .
Meanwhile the cookmaid took the fish and cleaned them and set the frying-pan on the fire .
Then she poured in oil of sesame and waited till it was <unk> , when she put in the fish .
As soon as one side was done , she fumed them , when lo , the wall of the kitchen opened and out came a handsome and well-shaped young lady , with smooth cheeks and liquid black eyes .
&#91; FN # 20 &#93; She was clad in a <unk> of satin , <unk> with <unk> of Egyptian gold , and on her head she had a silken kerchief , fringed with blue .
She wore rings in her ears and <unk> on her <unk> and rings on her fingers , with beazels of precious stones , and held in her hand a rod of Indian cane .
She came up to the brazier and thrust the rod into the frying-pan saying &apos; O fish , are you constant to your covenant ? &apos;
And when the cookmaid heard this she swooned away .
Then the damsel repeated her question a second and a third time ; and the fish lifted up their heads and cried out with one voice , &apos; Yes , yes : Return , and we return : keep faith , and so will we : Or , if thou wilt , forsake , and we &apos;ll do like to thee ! &apos;
With this the damsel overturned the frying-pan and went out by the way she had come , and the wall closed up again as before .
Presently the cookmaid came to herself and seeing the four fish burnt black as coal , said , &apos; My arms are broken in my first <unk> ! &apos;
And fell down again in a swoon .
Whilst she was in this state , in came the Vizier , to seek the fish , and found her insensible , not knowing <unk> from Thursday .
So he stirred her with his foot and she came to herself and wept and told him what had passed .
He marvelled and said , &apos; This is indeed a strange thing ! &apos;
Then he sent for the fisherman and said to him , &apos; O fisherman , bring us four more fish of the same kind . &apos;
So the fisherman repaired to the lake and cast his net and <unk> it in , found in it four fish like the first and carried them to the Vizier , who took them to the cookmaid and said to her , &apos; Come , fry them before me , that I may see what happens . &apos;
So she cleaned the fish and setting the frying-pan on the fire , threw them into it : and they had not lain long before the wall opened and the damsel appeared , after the same fashion , and thrust the rod into the pan , saying , &apos; O fish , O fish , are you constant to the old covenant ? &apos;
And behold the fish all lifted up their heads and cried out as before , &apos; Yes , yes : Return , and we return : keep faith , and so will we : Or , if thou wilt , forsake , and we &apos;ll do like to thee ! &apos;
Then she overturned the pan and went out as she had come and the wall closed up again .
When the Vizier saw this , he said , &apos; This is a thing that must not be kept from the King .
So he went to him and told him what he had witnessed ; and the King said , &apos; I must see this with my own eyes . &apos;
Then he sent for the fisherman and commanded him to bring him other four fish like the first ; and the fisherman went down at once to the lake and casting his net , caught other four fish and returned with them to the King , who ordered him other four hundred diners and set a guard upon him till he should see what happened .
Then he turned to the Vizier and said to him , &apos; Come thou and fry the fish before me . &apos;
Quoth the Vizier , &apos; I hear and obey . &apos;
So he fetched the frying-pan and setting it on the fire , cleaned the fish and threw them in : but hardly had he turned them , when the wall opened , and out came a black slave , as he were a mountain or one of the <unk> of the tribe of <unk> , &#91; FN # 21 &#93; with a branch of a green tree in his hand : and he said , in a terrible voice , &apos; O fish , O fish , are you constant to the old covenant ? &apos;
Whereupon they lifted up their heads and cried out &apos; &apos; Yes , yes ; we are constant : Return , and we return : keep faith , and so will we : Or , if thou wilt , forsake , and we &apos;ll do like to thee ! &apos;
Then the slave went up to the pan and <unk> it with the branch , went out as he had come , and the wall closed up as before .
The King looked at the fish and found them black as coal ; whereat he was bewildered and said to the Vizier , &apos; This is a thing about which it is <unk> to keep silence ; and indeed there must be some strange circumstance <unk> with these fish . &apos;
Then he sent for the fisherman and said to him , &apos; <unk> ye , <unk> , whence hadst thou those fish ? &apos;
<unk> a lake between four hills , &apos; answered he , &apos; on the thither side of the mountain behind the city . &apos;
&apos;How many days &apos; journey hence ? &apos;
asked the King ; and the fisherman said , &apos; O my lord Sultan , half an hour &apos;s journey . &apos;
At this the King was astonished and ordering the troops to mount , set out at once , followed by his suite and preceded by the fisherman , who began to curse the Afrit .
They rode on over the mountain and descended into a wide plain , that they had never before set eyes on , whereat they were all amazed .
Then they fared on till they came to the lake lying between the four hills and saw the fish therein of four colours , red and white and yellow and blue .
The King stood and wondered and said to his attendants , &apos; Has any one of you ever seen this lake before ? &apos;
But they answered , &apos; Never did we set eyes on it in all our lives , O King of the age . &apos;
Then he questioned those stricken in years , and they made him the same answer .
Quoth he , &apos; By Allah , I will not return to my capital nor sit down on my chair of estate till I know the secret of this <unk> and its fish ! &apos;
Then he ordered his people to <unk> at the foot of the hills and called his Vizier , who was a man of learning and experience , sagacious and skilful in business , and said to him , &apos; I mean to go forth alone to-night and enquire into the matter of the lake and these fish : wherefore do thou sit down at the door of my pavilion and tell the amirs and viziers and chamberlains and officers and all who ask after me that the Sultan is <unk> and hath ordered thee to admit no one , and do thou acquaint none with my purpose . &apos;
The Vizier dared not oppose his design ; so the King disguised himself and girt on his sword and going forth privily , took a path that led over one of the hills and fared on all that night and the next day , till the heat overcame him and he <unk> to rest .
Then he set out again and fared on the rest of that day and all the next night , till on the morning of the second day , he caught sight of some black thing in the distance , whereat he rejoiced and said , &apos; Belike I shall find some one who can tell me the secret of the lake and the fish . &apos;
So he walked on , till he came to the black object , when he found it a palace built of black stone , plated with iron ; and one leaf of its gate was open and the other shut .
At this the King rejoiced and went up to the gate and knocked lightly , but heard no answer .
So he knocked a second time and a third time , with the same <unk> .
Then he knocked <unk> , but still no one answered ; and he said to himself , &apos; It must be deserted . &apos;
So he took courage and entering the vestibule , cried out , &apos; Ho , people of the palace !
I am a stranger and a <unk> and hungry .
Have ye any victual ? &apos;
He repeated these words a second and a third time , but none answered .
So he took heart and went on <unk> into the <unk> of the palace , which he found hung and furnished with silken stuffs , embroidered with stars of gold , and curtains let down before the doors .
In the midst was a spacious courtyard , with four <unk> , one on each side , and a bench of stone .
Midmost the courtyard was a great basin of water , from which sprang a fountain , and at the corners stood four lions of red gold , spouting forth water as it were pearls and jewels ; and the place was full of birds , which were hindered from flying away by a network of gold stretched <unk> .
The King looked right and left , but there was no one to be seen ; whereat he marvelled and was vexed to find none of whom he might enquire concerning the lake and the fish and the palace itself .
So he returned to the vestibule and sitting down between the doors , fell to musing upon what he had seen , when lo , he heard a <unk> that came from a sorrowful heart , and a voice chanted the following verses : I hid what I endured from thee : it came to light , And sleep was changed to wake thenceforward to my sight .
O Fate , thou <unk> not nor dost desist from me ; Lo , for my heart is racked with <unk> and <unk> !
Have pity , lady mine , upon the great laid low , Upon the rich made poor by love and its despite !
Once , jealous of the breeze that blew on thee , I was , Alas !
on whom Fate falls , his eyes are veiled with night .
What boots the <unk> &apos;s skill , if , when the foe draws near , His <unk> <unk> and leave him helpless in the fight ?
So when afflictions press upon the noble mind , Where shall a man from Fate and <unk> take flight ?
When the King heard this , he rose and followed the sound and found that it came from behind a curtain let down before the doorway of a sitting-chamber .
So he raised the curtain and saw a young man seated upon a couch raised a <unk> from the ground .
He was a handsome well-shaped youth , with flower-white forehead and rosy cheeks and a black mole , like a grain of ambergris , on the table of his cheek , as says the poet : The slender one !
From his brow and the night of his jetty hair , The world in alternate gloom and splendour of day doth fare .
<unk> not the mole on his cheek .
Is an anemone &apos;s cup <unk> , except in its midst an <unk> of black it wear ?
He was clad in a robe of silk , laced with Egyptian gold , and had on his head a crown set with jewels , but his face bore traces of affliction .
The King rejoiced when he saw him and saluted him ; and the youth returned his salute in the most courteous wise , though without rising , and said to him , &apos; O my lord , excuse me if I do not rise to thee , as is thy due ; indeed , I am unable to do so . &apos;
&apos;I hold thee excused , O youth ! &apos;
answered the King .
&apos;I am thy guest and come to thee on a pressing errand , <unk> thee to expound to me the mystery of the lake and the fish and of this palace , and why thou <unk> here alone and weeping . &apos;
When the young man heard this , the tears ran down his cheeks and he wept sore , till his breast was <unk> , and repeated the following verses : Say unto those that grieve , at whom doth Fate her arrows cast , &quot; How many an one hath she raised up but to lay low at last !
Lo , if ye sleep , the eye of God is never closed in sleep .
For whom indeed is life serene , for whom is Fortune fast ? &quot;
Then he gave a heavy sigh and repeated the following : Trust thine affair to the <unk> of all that be And put thought-taking and trouble away from thee : Say not of aught that is past , &quot; How came it so ? &quot;
All things <unk> upon the Divine decree .
The King marvelled and said to him , &apos; What makes thee weep , O youth ? &apos;
&apos;How should I not weep , &apos; answered he &apos; being in such a plight ? &apos;
Then he put out his hand and lifted the skirt of his robe , and behold , he was stone from the waist downward .
When the King saw this his condition , he grieved sore and lamented and cried out , &apos; Alas !
alas ! &apos;
and said , &apos; Verily , O youth , thou addest trouble to my trouble .
I came to enquire concerning the fish ; and now I am concerned to know thy history also .
But there is no power and no virtue save in God the Most High , the Supreme !
<unk> therefore , O youth , and expound to me thy story . &apos;
Quoth the youth , &apos; Give me thine ears and understanding : &apos; and the King replied , &apos; I am all attention . &apos;
Then said the youth , &apos; There hangs a strange story by these fish and by myself , a story which , were it graven with needles on the corners of the eye , &#91; FN # 22 &#93; would serve as a warning to those who can profit by example .
&apos;How so ? &apos;
asked the King and the youth replied , &apos; Know , O my lord , that Story of the Enchanted Youth .
My father was King of the city that stood in this place , and his name was Mohammed , Lord of the Black Islands , which are no other than the four hills of which thou wottest .
He reigned seventy years , at the end of which time God took him to Himself , and I succeeded to his throne and took to wife the daughter of my father &apos;s brother , who loved me with an exceeding love , so that , whenever I was absent from her , she would neither eat nor drink till she saw me again .
With her I lived for five years , till one day she went out to go to the bath , and I bade the cook hasten supper for us against her return .
Then I entered the palace and lay down on the bed where we were wont to lie and ordered two slave-girls to sit , one at my head and the other at my feet , and fan me .
Now I was <unk> at my wife &apos;s absence and could not sleep , but remained awake , although my eyes were closed .
Presently I heard the damsel at my head say to the other one , &quot; O Mesoudeh , how unhappy is our lord and how wretched is his youth , and oh , the pity of him with our accursed harlot of a mistress ! &quot;
&quot; Yes , indeed , &quot; replied Mesoudeh ; &quot; may God curse all unfaithful women and <unk> !
Indeed , it befits not that the like of our lord should waste his youth with this harlot , who lies abroad every night . &quot;
Quoth the other , &quot; Is our lord then a fool , that , when he <unk> in the night and finds her not by his side , he makes no <unk> after her ? &quot;
&quot; Out on thee , &quot; rejoined Mesoudeh ; &quot; has our lord any knowledge of this or does she leave him any choice ?
<unk> she not drug him every night in the cup of drink she gives him before he sleeps , in which she puts henbane ?
So he sleeps like a dead man and knows nothing of what happens .
Then she dresses and scents herself and goes forth and is absent till daybreak , when she returns and burns a perfume under his nose and he <unk> . &quot;
When I heard the girls &apos; talk , the light in my eyes became darkness , and I thought the night would never come .
Presently , my wife returned from the bath , and they served up supper and we ate and sat awhile drinking and talking as usual .
Then she called for my <unk> and gave me the cup : and I feigned to drink it , but made shift to pour it into my bosom and lay down at once and began to <unk> as if I slept .
Then said she , &quot; Sleep out thy night and never rise again !
By Allah , I hate thee and I hate thy person ; I am sick of thy company and I know not when God will take away thy life ! &quot;
Then she rose and donned her richest clothes and perfumed herself and girt on my sword and opened the palace gate and went out .
I rose and followed her , and she passed through the streets of the city , till she came to the gate , when she muttered words I understood not : and <unk> the locks fell off and the gate opened .
She went forth and fared on among the rubbish heaps , I still following her without her knowledge , till she came to a <unk> <unk> , within which was a hut of <unk> .
She entered the hut and I climbed up on the roof and looking down , saw my wife standing by a scurvy black slave , with <unk> lips , one of which <unk> the other , like a coverlet , and swept up the sand from the <unk> floor , lying upon a bed of <unk> refuse and wrapped in an old cloak and a few rags .
She kissed the earth before him , and he raised his head to her and said , &quot; Out on thee !
why hast thou tarried till now ?
There have been some of my kinsmen the blacks here , drinking ; and they have gone away , each with his <unk> ; but I refused to drink on account of thine absence . &quot;
&quot; O my lord and my love and solace of my eyes , &quot; answered she , &quot; dost thou not know that I am married to my cousin , and that I hate to look upon him and abhor myself in his company .
Did I not fear for thy sake , I would not let the sun rise again till his city was a heap of ruins wherein the <unk> and the raven should <unk> and wolves and <unk> harbour ; and I would transport its stones behind the mountain Caf .
&quot; &#91; FN # 23 &#93; &quot; Thou liest , O accursed one ! &quot;
said the black , &quot; and I swear by the <unk> of the blacks ( else may our manhood be as that of the whites ! )
that if thou tarry again till this hour , I will no longer keep thee company nor join my body to thine !
O accursed one , wilt thou play fast and loose with us at thy pleasure , O stinkard , O bitch , O vilest of whites ? &quot;
When I heard and saw what passed between them , the world grew dark in my eyes and I knew not where I was ; whilst my wife stood weeping and <unk> herself to him and saying , &quot; O my love and fruit of my heart , if thou be angry with me , who is left me , and if thou reject me , who shall shelter me , O my beloved and light of mine eyes ? &quot;
And she ceased not to weep and implore him till he forgave her .
Then she was glad and rose and putting off her clothes , said to the slave , &quot; O my lord , hast thou aught here for thy handmaid to eat ? &quot;
&quot; Take the cover off yonder basin , &quot; answered he ; &quot; thou wilt find under it cooked <unk> &apos; bones , and there is a little <unk> <unk> left in this pot .
Eat and drink . &quot;
So she ate and drank and washed her hands and mouth ; then lay down , naked , upon the <unk> , beside the slave , and covered herself with the rags .
When I saw this , I became as one distraught and coming down from the roof , went in by the door .
Then I took the sword she had brought and drew it , thinking to kill them both .
I struck first at the slave &apos;s neck and thought I had made an end of him ; but the blow only severed the flesh and the gullet , without dividing the <unk> .
He gave a loud <unk> groan and roused my wife , whereupon I drew back , after I had restored the sword to its place , and <unk> to the palace , lay down on my bed till morning , when my wife came and awoke me , and I saw that she had cut off her hair and put on mourning garments .
&quot; O my cousin , &quot; said she , &quot; do not blame me for this I have done ; for I have news that my mother is dead , that my father has fallen in battle and that both my brothers are dead also , one of a <unk> and the other of a fall from a <unk> , so that I have good reason to weep and lament . &quot;
When I heard this , I did not reproach her , but said to her , &quot; Do what thou wilt : I will not baulk thee . &quot;
She ceased not to mourn and lament for a whole year , at the end of which time she said to me , &quot; I wish to build me in thy palace a tomb with a <unk> and set it apart for mourning and call it <unk> of <unk> . &quot;
Quoth I , &quot; Do what seemeth good to thee . &quot;
So she built herself a house of mourning , <unk> with a dome , and a <unk> in the midst like the tomb of a <unk> .
<unk> she transported the slave and lodged him in the tomb .
He was exceeding weak and from the day I wounded him he had remained unable to do her any service or to speak or do aught but drink ; but he was still alive , because his hour was not yet come .
She used to visit him morning and evening in the mausoleum and carry him wine and broths to drink and weep and make moan over him ; and thus she did for another year , whilst I ceased not to have patience with her and pay no heed to her doings , till one day I came upon her unawares and found her weeping and saying , &quot; Why art thou absent from my sight , O delight of my heart ?
Speak to me , O my life !
speak to me , O my love ! &quot;
And she recited the following verses : My patience fails me for desire : if thou <unk> me , My heart and all my soul can love none other after thee .
Carry me with thee , body and soul , wherever thou dost fare , And where thou <unk> down to rest , there let me buried be .
Speak but my name above my tomb ; the <unk> of my bones , <unk> towards thy voice &apos;s sound , shall answer <unk> .
And she wept and recited the following : My day of <unk> is that whereon thou <unk> near to me ; And that whereon thou turn &apos;st away , my day of death and fear .
What though I tremble all the night and be in dread of death , Yet thine embraces are to me than safety far more dear .
And again the following : Though unto me were given all that can make life sweet , Though the Chosroes empire , <unk> , and the world were mine , All were to me in value less than a <unk> &apos;s wing , If that mine eyes must never look on that face of thine !
When she had finished , I said to her , &quot; O my cousin , let thy mourning suffice thee : for weeping <unk> nothing . &quot;
She replied , &quot; <unk> me not , or I will kill myself . &quot;
So I held my peace and let her go her way : and she ceased not to mourn and weep for the space of another year .
At the end of the third year , I came into the mausoleum one day , vexed at something that had crossed me and weary of this <unk> affliction , and found her by the tomb under the dome , saying , &quot; O my lord , I never hear thee speak to me , no , not one word .
Why dost thou not answer me , O my lord ? &quot;
And she recited the following verses : O tomb , O tomb , have his beauties ceased , or does thy light indeed , The sheen of the radiant countenance , no more in thee abound ?
O tomb , O tomb , thou art neither earth nor heaven unto me : How comes it then that sun and moon at once in thee are found ?
When I heard this , it added wrath to my wrath , and I said , &quot; Alas !
how much more of this mourning ? &quot;
and I repeated the following &#91; <unk> of her &#93; verses : O tomb , O tomb , has his blackness ceased , or does thy light indeed , The sheen of the filthy countenance , no more in thee abound ?
O tomb , thou art neither <unk> nor <unk> for me !
How comes it then that mire and coal at once in thee are found ?
When she heard this , she sprang to her feet and said , &quot; Out on thee , thou dog !
it was thou that didst thus with me and <unk> the beloved of my heart and hast afflicted me and wasted his youth , so that these three years he hath lain , neither dead nor alive ! &quot;
&quot; O foulest of <unk> and <unk> of <unk> <unk> of hired slaves , &quot; answered I , &quot; it was indeed I who did this ! &quot;
And I drew my sword and made at her to kill her ; but she laughed and said , &quot; <unk> , thou dog !
<unk> thou that what is past can recur or the dead come back to life ?
Verily , God has given into my hand him who did this to me and against whom there was in my heart fire that might not be quenched and <unk> rage . &quot;
Then she stood up and <unk> some words I did not understand , said to me , &quot; Let one half of thee by my enchantments become stone and the other half remain man . &quot;
And immediately I became as thou seest me and have remained ever since neither sitting nor standing and neither dead nor alive .
Then she enchanted the city with all its streets and gardens and turned it into the lake thou wottest of , and the inhabitants , who were of four <unk> , Muslims , Christians , Magians and Jews , she changed to fish of various colours , the Muslims white , the Christians blue , the Magians red and the Jews yellow ; and the four islands she turned into four mountains encompassing the lake .
Moreover , the condition to which she has reduced me does not suffice her : but every day she strips me and gives me a hundred lashes with a whip , so that the blood runs down me and my shoulders are torn .
Then she clothes my upper half in a shirt of hair-cloth and over that she <unk> these rich robes . &apos;
And he wept and repeated the following verses : Lord , I submit myself to Thee and eke to Fate , <unk> , if so Thou please , to suffer and to wait .
My enemies oppress and torture me full sore : But Paradise at last , belike , shall <unk> .
Though Fate press hard on me , I trust in the <unk> , &#91; FN # 24 &#93; The <unk> One of God , to be my <unk> .
With this the King turned to him and said , &apos; O youth , after having rid me of one trouble , thou addest another to me : but tell me , where is thy wife and where is the wounded slave ? &apos;
&apos;The slave lies in the tomb under the dome , &apos; answered the youth , &apos; and she is in the chamber over against the gate .
Every day at sunrise , she comes out and <unk> first to me and strips off my clothes and gives me a hundred strokes with the whip ; and I weep and cry out , but cannot stir to keep her off .
When she has done <unk> me , she goes down to the slave with the wine and broth on which she <unk> him ; and to-morrow at sunrise she will come . &apos;
&apos;O youth , &apos; rejoined the King , &apos; by Allah , I will assuredly do thee a service by which I shall be remembered and which men shall <unk> to the end of time ! &apos;
Then he sat down by the youth and talked with him till nightfall , when they went to sleep .
At <unk> of day , the King rose and put off his clothes and drawing his sword , repaired to the mausoleum , where , after noting the <unk> of the place and the candles and <unk> and perfumes burning there , he sought for the slave till he came upon him and slew him with one blow of the sword ; after which he took the body on his back and threw it into a well that was in the palace .
Then he returned to the dome and wrapping himself in the black &apos;s clothes , lay down in his place , with his drawn sword by his side .
After awhile , the accursed enchantress came out and , going first to her husband , stripped him and beat him with the whip , whilst he cried out , &apos; Alas !
the state I am in suffices me .
Have mercy on me , O my cousin ! &apos;
But she replied , &apos; Didst thou show me any mercy or spare my beloved ? &apos;
And beat him till she was tired and the blood ran from his sides .
Then she put the hair shirt on him and the royal robes over it , and went down to the dome with a <unk> of wine and a bowl of broth in her hands .
When she came to the tomb , she fell a-weeping and <unk> and said , &apos; O my lord , speak to me ! &apos;
And repeated the following verse : How long ere this rigour pass sway and thou relent ?
Is it not yet enough of the tears that I have spent ? &apos;
And she wept and said again , &apos; O my lord , speak to me ! &apos;
The King <unk> his voice and <unk> his tongue , spoke after the fashion of the blacks and said , &apos; Alack !
<unk> !
there is no power and no virtue but in God the Most High the Supreme ! &apos;
When she heard this , she screamed out for joy and swooned away ; and when she revived , she said , &apos; O my lord , can it be true and didst thou indeed speak to me ? &apos;
The King made his voice small and said , &apos; O accursed woman , thou <unk> not that I should speak to thee ! &apos;
&apos;Why so ? &apos;
asked she ; and he replied , &apos; Because all day thou <unk> thy husband and his cries <unk> me , and all night long he calls upon God for help and <unk> <unk> on thee and me and keeps me awake from nightfall to daybreak and <unk> me ; and but for this , I had been well long ago .
This is what has hindered me from <unk> thee . &apos;
Quoth she , &apos; With thy leave , I will release him from his present condition . &apos;
&apos;Do so , &apos; said the King , &apos; and rid us of his noise . &apos;
&apos;I hear and obey , &apos; answered she , and going out into the palace , took a cup full of water and spoke over it certain words , whereupon the water began to boil and <unk> as the <unk> <unk> over the fire .
Then she went up to the young King and sprinkled him with it , saying , &apos; By the virtue of the words I have spoken , if thou art thus by my <unk> , <unk> this shape for thy former one . &apos;
And immediately he shook and rose to his feet , rejoicing in his deliverance , and said , &apos; I testify that there is no god but God and that Mohammed is His apostle , may God bless and preserve him ! &apos;
Then she said to him , &apos; Depart hence and do not return , or I will kill thee . &apos;
And she screamed out in his face .
So he went out from before her , and she returned to the dome and going down into the tomb , said , &apos; O my lord , come forth to me , that I may see thy goodly form ! &apos;
The King replied in a weak voice , &apos; What hast thou done ?
Thou hast rid me of the branch , but not of the root . &apos;
&apos;O my beloved , O my little black , &apos; said she , &apos; what is the root ? &apos;
&apos;Out on thee , O accursed one ! &apos;
answered he .
<unk> night , at the middle hour , the people of the city , whom thou by thine enchantments didst change into fish , lift up their heads from the water and cry to God for help and curse thee and me ; and this is what <unk> my recovery : so do thou go quickly and set them free , and after return and take me by the hand and raise me up ; for indeed health returns to me . &apos;
When she heard this speech of the King , whom she supposed to be the slave , she rejoiced and said , &apos; O my lord , on my head and eyes be it , in the name of God ! &apos;
Then she went out , full of joy , and ran to the lake and taking a little of the water in her hand , spoke over it words that might not be understood , whereupon there was a great stir among the fish ; and they raised their heads to the surface and stood upright and became men as before .
Thus was the spell <unk> from the people of the city and the lake became again a <unk> city , with its streets and bazaars , in which the merchants bought and sold , and every one returned to his employment ; whilst the four hills were restored to their original form of islands .
Then the enchantress returned to the King and said to him , &apos; O my lord , give me thy noble hand and arise . &apos;
&apos;Come nearer to me , &apos; answered he , in a faint voice .
So she came close to him , and he took his sword and smote her in the breast , that the steel came forth , gleaming , from her back .
He smote her again and cut her in twain , and she fell to the ground in two <unk> .
Then he went out and found the young King standing awaiting him and gave him joy of his deliverance , whereupon the youth rejoiced and thanked him and kissed his hand .
Quoth the Sultan , &apos; Wilt thou abide in this thy city or come with me to mine ? &apos;
&apos;O King of the age , &apos; rejoined he , &apos; dost thou know how far it is from here to thy capital ? &apos;
And the Sultan replied , &apos; Two and a half days &apos; journey . &apos;
&apos;O King , &apos; said the other , &apos; if thou sleepest , awake !
Between thee and thy capital is a full year &apos;s journey to a <unk> traveller ; and thou hadst not come hither in two days and a half , save that the city was enchanted .
But , O King , I will never leave thee , no , not for the twinkling of an eye ! &apos;
The Sultan rejoiced at his words and said , &apos; Praised be God , who hath bestowed thee upon me !
Thou shalt be my son , for in all my life I have never been blessed with a son . &apos;
And they embraced each other and rejoiced with exceeding great joy .
Then they returned to the palace , and the young King bade his officers make ready for a journey and prepare his baggage and all that he required .
The preparations occupied ten days , at the end of which time the young King set out in company of the Sultan , whose heart burned within him at the thought of his long absence from his capital , attended by fifty white slaves and provided with magnificent presents .
They journeyed day and night for a whole year , and God ordained them safety , till they drew near the Sultan &apos;s capital and sent messengers in advance to acquaint the Vizier with his safe arrival .
Then came out the Vizier and the troops , who had given up all hope of the Sultan &apos;s return , and kissed the ground before him and gave him joy of his safety .
So he entered his palace and sat down on his throne and the Vizier came in to him , to whom he related all that had befallen him with the young King : and the Vizier gave the latter joy of his deliverance .
Then all things being set in order , the Sultan gave largesse to many of his people and sending for the fisherman who had brought him the enchanted fish and had thus been the first cause of the delivery of the people of the Black Islands , bestowed on him a dress of honour and enquired of his condition and whether he had any children , to which he replied that he had three children , two daughters and one son .
So the King sent for them and taking one daughter to wife , married the other to the young King and made the son his treasurer .
Moreover , he invested his Vizier with the sovereignty of the Black Islands and despatched him thither with the fifty officers , who had accompanied the young King thence , giving him robes of honour for all the amirs .
So the Vizier kissed hands and set out for the Black Islands .
The fisherman became the richest man of his time , and he and his daughters and the two Kings their husbands abode in peace till death came to them .
THE <unk> AND THE THREE <unk> OF <unk> .
There was once a porter of Baghdad who was a <unk> .
One day , as he stood in the market , leant upon his basket , there came to him a lady , <unk> in a <unk> of gold embroidered muslin , fringed with gold <unk> , and wearing embroidered boots and floating tresses plaited with silk and gold .
She stopped before him and raising her kerchief , showed a pair of languishing black eyes of perfect beauty , bordered with long <unk> lashes .
Then she turned to the porter and said , in a clear sweet voice , &apos; Take thy basket and follow me . &apos;
No sooner had she spoken than he took up his basket in haste , saying , &apos; O day of good luck !
O day of God &apos;s grace ! &apos;
and followed her till she stopped and knocked at the door of a house , when there came out a <unk> , to whom she gave a dinar , and he gave her in return an <unk> bottle , full of wine , which she put into the basket , saying to the porter , &apos; Hoist up and follow me . &apos;
Said he , &apos; By Allah , this is indeed a happy and fortunate day ! &apos;
And <unk> the basket , followed her till she came to a fruiterer &apos;s , where she bought Syrian apples and Turkish <unk> and Arabian <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> oranges and citrons , beside jessamine of Aleppo and Damascus <unk> and myrtle and basil and <unk> and blood-red anemones and violets and <unk> and narcissus and camomile and pomegranate flowers , all of which she put into the porter &apos;s basket , saying , &apos; Hoist up ! &apos;
So he shouldered the basket and followed her , till she stopped at a butcher &apos;s shop and said to him , &apos; Cut me off ten pounds of meat . &apos;
He gave her the meat , wrapped in a banana leaf , and she put it in the basket , saying , &apos; Hoist up , O porter ! &apos;
and went on to a grocer &apos;s , of whom she took <unk> <unk> and <unk> almonds and hazel-nuts and walnuts and sugar cane and parched <unk> and Mecca raisins and all else that <unk> to dessert .
Thence to a <unk> &apos;s , where she bought a covered dish and put therein <unk> tarts and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> , flavoured with lemon and melon , and <unk> &apos;s <unk> and ladies &apos; fingers and Cadi &apos;s <unk> and widow &apos;s bread and <unk> &#91; FN # 25 &#93; and some of every kind of <unk> in the shop and laid the dish in the basket of the porter , who said to her , &apos; Thou shouldst have told me , that I might have brought a mule or a camel to carry all these good things . &apos;
She smiled and gave him a <unk> on the nape , saying , &apos; Make haste and leave chattering and God willing , thou shalt have a good wage . &apos;
She stopped next at the shop of a druggist , where she bought rose-water and <unk> water and <unk> water and willow-flower water and six other kinds of sweet waters and a casting bottle of rose-water mingled with musk , besides two <unk> of sugar and <unk> and aloes-wood and ambergris and musk and saffron and candles of Alexandrian wax , all of which she put into the basket .
Then she went on to a greengrocer &apos;s , of whom she bought <unk> <unk> and <unk> , in <unk> and fresh , and <unk> and <unk> and Syrian <unk> and put them all into the basket and said to the porter , &apos; Take up thy basket and follow me . &apos;
So he shouldered his load and followed her till she came to a tall handsome house , with a spacious court before it and a <unk> door of ebony , inlaid with plates of glittering gold .
The lady went up to the door and throwing back her kerchief , knocked softly , whilst the porter stood behind her , musing upon her beauty and grace .
After awhile the door opened and both the leaves <unk> back ; whereupon he looked to see who opened it , and behold , it was a damsel of <unk> beauty and symmetry , high-bosomed , with flower-white forehead and rosy cheeks , eyes like those of gazelles or wild <unk> and eyebrows like the crescent of the new moon of <unk> &#91; FN # 26 &#93; , cheeks like blood-red anemones , mouth like Solomon &apos;s seal , lips red as coral and teeth like <unk> pearls or camomile-petals , neck like an <unk> &apos;s and bosom like a fountain , breasts like double pomegranates , belly like brocade and navel holding an <unk> of <unk> ointment , even as says of her the poet : Look at her , with her slender shape and radiant beauty !
this Is she who is at once the sun and moon of palaces !
Thine eyes shall ne &apos;er see grace combine so featly black and white As in her visage and the locks that o &apos;er her forehead kiss .
She in whose cheeks the red <unk> waves , her beauty <unk> Unto her name , if that to paint her sweet <unk> miss .
With swimming gait she walks : I laugh for wonder at her hips , But weep to see her waist , that all too slight to bear them is .
When the porter saw her , his mind and heart were taken by storm , so that he well-nigh let fall the basket and exclaimed , &apos; Never in all my life saw I a more blessed day than this ! &apos;
Then said the portress to the cateress , &apos; O my <unk> , why <unk> thou ?
Come in from the gate and ease this poor man of his burden . &apos;
So the cateress entered , followed by the portress and the porter , and went on before them to a spacious saloon , elegantly built and handsomely decorated with all manner of colours and <unk> and <unk> figures , with <unk> and <unk> and cupboards and benches and closets with curtains drawn before them .
In the midst was a great basin of water , from which rose a fountain , and at the upper end stood a couch of juniper wood , inlaid with precious stones and <unk> by a canopy of red satin , looped up with pearls as big as hazel-nuts or <unk> .
<unk> sat a lady of radiant countenance and gentle and <unk> aspect , <unk> in face , with eyes of <unk> <unk> and arched eyebrows , <unk> lips like cornelian and a shape like the letter I.
The radiance of her countenance would have shamed the rising sun , and she <unk> one of the chief stars of heaven or a pavilion of gold or a <unk> Arabian bride on the night of her unveiling , even as says of her the poet : Her teeth , when she <unk> , like pearls in a cluster show , Or <unk> camomile-petals or <unk> of snow : Her ringlets seem , as it were , the fallen night , And her beauty <unk> the dawn and its ruddy glow .
Then she rose and coming with a stately gait to meet her sisters in the middle of the saloon , said to them , &apos; Why stand ye still ?
<unk> this poor porter of his burden . &apos;
So the cateress came and stood before and the portress behind him and with the help of the third damsel , lifted the basket from his head and <unk> it , laid everything in its place .
Then they gave him two dinars , saying , &apos; Go , O porter ! &apos;
But he stood , looking at the ladies and <unk> , their beauty and pleasant manners , never had he seen <unk> , and wondering greatly at the profusion of wine and meat and fruits and flowers and so forth that they had provided and to see no man with them , and made no movement to go .
So the eldest lady said to him , &apos; What ails thee that thou dost not go away ?
Belike , thou <unk> at thy pay ? &apos;
And she turned to the cateress and said to her , &apos; Give him another dinar . &apos;
&apos;No , by Allah , O lady ! &apos;
answered the porter .
&apos;I do not indeed <unk> at my pay , for my right hire is scarce two dirhems ; but of a truth my heart and soul are taken up with you and how it is that ye are alone and have no man with you and no one to divert you , although ye know that women &apos;s sport is little worth without men , nor is an entertainment complete without four at the table , and ye have no fourth .
What says the poet ?
Dost thou not see that for pleasure four several things combine , <unk> four , harp , <unk> and <unk> and psaltery ?
And unto these , four perfumes answer and <unk> , <unk> , roses and myrtle and blood-red anemone .
Nor is our pleasure perfect , unless four things have we , <unk> and wine and gardens and mistress fair and free .
And ye are three and need a fourth , who should be a man , witty , <unk> and discreet , one who can keep counsel . &apos;
When they heard what he said , it amused them and they laughed at him and replied , &apos; What have we to do with that , we who are girls and fear to <unk> our secrets to those who will not keep them ?
For we have read , in such and such a history , what says Ibn <unk> <unk> : Tell not thy secrets : keep them with all thy might .
A secret revealed is a secret lost outright .
If thine own bosom cannot thy secrets hold , Why expect more <unk> from another wight ?
Or , as well says Abou <unk> on the same subject : The fool , that to men doth his secrets <unk> , <unk> to be marked with a <unk> on the brow . &apos;
&apos;By your lives , &apos; rejoined the porter , &apos; I am a man of sense and discretion , well read in books and chronicles .
I make known what is fair and conceal what is foul , and as says the poet : None keeps a secret but the man who &apos;s trusty and discreet .
A secret &apos;s ever safely placed with <unk> folk and <unk> ; And secrets <unk> unto me are in a <unk> house Whose keys are lost and on whose door is set the Cadi &apos;s seal .
When the girls heard this , the eldest one said to him , &apos; Thou knowest that we have laid out much money in preparing this entertainment : hast thou aught to offer us in return ?
For we will not let thee sit with us and be our boon companion and gaze on our bright fair faces , except thou pay down thy share of the cost .
Dost thou not know the saying : Love without money Is not worth a <unk> ? &apos;
&apos;If thou have aught , my friend , &apos; added the portress , &apos; then art thou something : but if thou have nothing , be off without anything . &apos;
Here the cateress interposed , saying , &apos; O sisters , let him be : for by Allah , he has not failed us to-day : another had not been so patient with us .
I will pay his share for him . &apos;
Whereupon the porter , <unk> , kissed the earth and thanked her , saying , &apos; By Allah , it was thou didst handsel me this day !
Here are the two dinars I had of you : take them and admit me to your company , not as a guest , but as a servant . &apos;
<unk> down , &apos; answered they ; &apos; thou art welcome . &apos;
But the eldest lady said , &apos; By Allah , we will not admit thee to our <unk> but on one condition ; and it is that thou enquire not of what does not concern thee ; and if thou meddle , thou shalt be beaten . &apos;
Said the porter , &apos; I agree to this , O my lady , on my head and eyes !
Henceforth I am dumb . &apos;
Then arose the cateress and <unk> her middle , laid the table by the fountain and set out the cups and flagons , with flowers and sweet herbs and all the <unk> for drinking .
Moreover , she strained the wine and set it on ; and they sat down , she and her sisters , with the porter , who fancied himself in a dream .
The cateress took the flagon of wine and filled a cup and drank it off .
Then she filled again and gave it to one of her sisters , who drank and filled another cup and gave it to her other sister : then she filled a fourth time and gave it to the porter , saying : Drink and fare well and health attend thee still .
This drink indeed &apos;s a cure for every ill .
He took the cup in his hand and bowed and returned thanks , reciting the following verses : <unk> not the cup except with one who is of trusty stuff , One who is true of thought and deed and eke of good <unk> .
Wine &apos;s like the wind , that , if it breathe on perfume , <unk> as sweet , But , if o &apos;er <unk> it pass , <unk> its evil scent .
And again : Drink not of wine except at the hands of a <unk> fair , Who , like unto thee and it , is <unk> and debonair .
Then he kissed their hands and drank and was merry with wine and swayed from side to side and recited the following verses : <unk> , by Allah , I conjure thee !
<unk> that full of the <unk> <unk> be !
And brim up , I prithee , a cup for me , For this is the water of life , <unk> !
Then the cateress filled the cup and gave it to the portress , who took it from her hand and thanked her and drank .
Then she filled again and gave it to the eldest , who filled another cup and handed it to the porter .
He gave thanks and drank and recited the following verses : It is forbidden us to drink of any blood Except it be of that which <unk> from the <unk> .
So pour it out to me , an <unk> to thine eyes , To ransom from thy hands my soul and all that &apos;s mine .
Then he turned to the eldest lady , who was the mistress of the house , and said to her , &apos; O my lady , I am thy slave and thy servant and thy <unk> ! &apos;
And repeated the following verses : There is a slave of all thy <unk> now standing at thy gate Who <unk> not thy bounties all to sing and celebrate .
May he come in , O lady fair , to gaze upon thy charms ?
<unk> and I from thee indeed may never separate .
And she said to him , &apos; Drink , and health and prosperity attend thee ! &apos;
So he took the cup and kissed her hand and sang the following verses : I brought my love old wine and pure , the likeness of her cheeks , Whose <unk> brightness called to mind a brazier &apos;s heart of red .
She touched the <unk> with her lips , and laughing <unk> , &quot; How canst thou proffer me to drink of my own cheeks ? &quot;
she said .
&quot; Drink ! &quot;
answered I , &quot; it is my tears ; its hue is of my blood ; And it was heated at a fire that by my sighs was fed . &quot;
And she answered him with the following verse : If , O my friend , thou hast indeed wept tears of blood for me , I prithee , give them me to drink , upon thine eyes and head !
Then she took the cup and drank it off to her sisters &apos; health ; and they continued to drink and make merry , <unk> and laughing and singing and reciting verses and <unk> .
The porter fell to toying and kissing and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and dallying and taking <unk> with them : whilst one put a morsel into his mouth and another thumped him , and this one gave him a cuff and that pelted him with flowers ; and he led the most delightful life with them , as if he sat in paradise among the houris .
They ceased not to drink and carouse thus , till the wine sported in their heads and got the better of their senses , when the portress , arose , and putting off her clothes , let down her hair over her naked body , for a veil .
Then she threw herself into the basin and sported in the water and swam about and dived like a <unk> and took water in her mouth and <unk> it at the porter and washed her <unk> and the inside of her thighs .
Then she came up out of the water and throwing herself into the porter &apos;s lap , pointed to her commodity and said to him , &apos; O my lord O my friend , what is the name of this ? &apos;
&apos;Thy kaze , &apos; answered he ; but she said , &apos; Fie !
art thou not ashamed ! &apos;
And cuffed him on the nape of the neck .
Quoth he , &apos; Thy catso . &apos;
And she dealt him a second cuff , saying , &apos; Fie !
what an ugly word !
Art thou not ashamed ? &apos;
&apos;Thy commodity , &apos; said he ; and she , &apos; Fie !
is there no shame in thee ? &apos;
And thumped him and beat him .
Then said he , &apos; Thy coney . &apos;
Whereupon the eldest fell on him and beat him , saying , &apos; Thou shalt not say that . &apos;
And whatever he said , they beat him more and more , till his neck ached again ; and they made a laughing-stock of him amongst them , till he said at last , &apos; Well , what is its name amongst you women ? &apos;
&apos;The sweet basil of the dykes , &apos; answered they .
<unk> be God for safety ! &apos;
cried he .
&apos;Good , O sweet basil of the <unk> ! &apos;
Then they passed round the cup and presently the cateress rose and throwing herself into the porter &apos;s lap , pointed to her kaze and said to him , &apos; O light of mine eyes , what is the name of this ? &apos;
&apos;Thy commodity , &apos; answered he .
&apos;Art thou not ashamed ? &apos;
said she , and dealt him a buffet that made the place ring again , repeating , &apos; Fie !
Fie !
art thou not ashamed ? &apos;
Quoth he , &apos; The sweet basil of the dykes . &apos;
&apos;No !
No ! &apos;
answered she , and beat him and cuffed him on the nape .
Then said he , &apos; Thy kaze , thy <unk> , thy catso , thy coney . &apos;
But they replied , &apos; No !
No ! &apos;
And he said again , &apos; The sweet basil of the dykes . &apos;
Whereupon they laughed till they fell backward and cuffed him on the neck , saying , &apos; No ; that is not its name . &apos;
At last he said , &apos; O my sisters , what is its name ? &apos;
And they answered , &apos; What sayest thou to the peeled barleycorn ? &apos;
Then the cateress put on her clothes and they sat down again to carouse , whilst the porter lamented over his neck and shoulders .
The cup passed round among them awhile , and presently the eldest and handsomest of the ladies rose and put off her clothes ; whereupon the porter took his neck in his hand and said , &apos; My neck and shoulders are in the way of God ! &apos;
Then she threw herself into the basin and plunged and sported and washed ; whilst the porter looked at her , naked , as she were a piece of the moon or the full moon when she waxes or the dawn at its <unk> , and noted her shape and breasts and her heavy <unk> buttocks , for she was naked as God created her .
And he said , &apos; Alack ! &apos;
Alack ! &apos;
and repeated the following verses : If to the <unk> branch thy figure I compare , I lay upon my heart a load of wrong too great to bear ; For that the branch most lovely is , when clad upon with green , But thou , when free of every veil , art then by far most fair .
When she heard this , she came up out of the water and sitting down on his knees , pointed to her kaze and said , &apos; O my little lord , what is the name of this ? &apos;
&apos;The sweet basil of the dykes , &apos; answered he ; but she said , &apos; No !
No ! &apos;
Quoth he , &apos; The peeled barleycorn . &apos;
And she said , &apos; <unk> ! &apos;
Then said he , &apos; Thy kaze . &apos;
Fie !
Fie ! &apos;
cried she .
&apos;Art thou not ashamed ? &apos;
And cuffed him on the nape of the neck .
And whatever name he said , they beat him , saying , &apos; No !
No ! &apos;
till at last he said , &apos; O my sisters , what is its name ? &apos;
&apos;The khan &#91; FN # 27 &#93; of Abou Mensour , &apos; answered they .
And he said , &apos; Praised be God for safety !
Bravo !
Bravo !
O khan of Abou Mensour ! &apos;
Then the damsel rose and put on her clothes and they returned to their carousing and the cup passed round awhile .
Presently , the porter rose and putting off his clothes , plunged into the pool and swam about and washed under his chin and <unk> , even as they had done .
Then he came out and threw himself into the eldest lady &apos;s lap and putting his arms into the portress &apos;s lap and his feet into that of the cateress pointed to his codpiece and said , &apos; O my <unk> , what is the name of this ? &apos;
They laughed till they fell backward and one of them answered , &apos; Thy yard . &apos;
&apos;Art thou not ashamed ? &apos;
said he .
<unk> forfeit ! &apos;
and took of each a kiss .
Quoth another , &apos; Thy pintle . &apos;
But he replied , &apos; No , &apos; and gave each of them a bite in play .
Then said they , &apos; Thy pizzle . &apos;
&apos;No , &apos; answered he , and gave each of them a <unk> ; and they kept saying , &apos; Thy yard , thy pintle , thy pizzle , thy codpiece ! &apos;
whilst he kissed and <unk> and <unk> them to his heart &apos;s content , and they laughed till they were well nigh dead .
At last they said , &apos; O our brother , and what is its name ? &apos;
<unk> &apos;t you know ? &apos;
asked he ; and they said , &apos; No . &apos;
Quoth he , &apos; This is the mule <unk> , that <unk> on the basil of the dykes and <unk> up the peeled barleycorn and lies by night in the khan of Abou Mensour . &apos;
And they laughed till they fell backward .
Then they fell again to drinking and continued after this fashion till the night came upon them , when they said to the porter , &apos; In the name of God , put on thy sandals and be off and let us see the breadth of thy shoulders ! &apos;
Quoth he , &apos; By Allah , the leaving life were <unk> to me than the leaving you !
Let us join the night to the day , and to-morrow we will each go our own way . &apos;
&apos;My life on you ! &apos;
said the cateress , &apos; let him pass the night with us , that we may laugh at him , for he is a pleasant rogue ; and we may never again chance upon the like of him . &apos;
So the mistress of the house said to the porter , &apos; Thou shalt pass the night with us on condition that thou submit to our authority and that , whatever thou seest , thou ask no questions about it nor enquire the reason of it . &apos;
&apos;It is well , &apos; answered he ; and they said , &apos; Go and read what is written over the door . &apos;
So he went to the door and found the following words written thereon in letters of gold , &apos; He who speaks of what concerns him not , shall hear what will not please him . &apos;
And he said , &apos; Be ye witness against me that I will not speak of what concerns me not . &apos;
Then rose the cateress and prepared food , and they ate : after which they lighted the lamps and candles and strewed on the latter ambergris and aloes-wood ; then changed the service and set on fresh fruits and flowers and wine and so forth and sat down again to drink .
They ceased not to eat and drink and make merry , <unk> and laughing and talking and <unk> , till there came a knocking at the door : whereupon one of them rose and went to the door , without <unk> the party , and presently returned , saying , &apos; Verily , our pleasure is to be complete to-night . &apos;
&apos;How so ? &apos;
asked the others , and she replied , &apos; There are three foreign Calenders &#91; FN # 28 &#93; at the door , with shaven heads and <unk> and eyebrows and every one blind of the right eye , which is a most extraordinary <unk> .
Apparently they are fresh from a journey and indeed the traces of travel are evident on them ; and the reason of their knocking at the door is this .
They are strangers to Baghdad and this is their first coming to our city : the night surprised them and they could not find a lodging in the city and know no one with whom to take shelter : so they said to each other , &quot; Perhaps the owner of this house will give us the <unk> of a stable or <unk> and let us sleep there . &quot;
And , O my sisters , each of them is a laughing-stock after his own fashion ; and if we let them in , they will make us sport this night , and on the morrow each shall go his own way . &apos;
And she ceased not to persuade them , till they said , &apos; Let them come in , on condition that they ask no questions of what does not concern them , on pain of hearing what will not please them . &apos;
So she rejoiced and going to the door , returned with the three Calenders , who saluted and bowed low and held back ; but the ladies rose to them and welcomed them and gave them joy of their safety and made them sit down .
The Calenders looked about them and seeing a pleasant place and a table elegantly spread with flowers and fruits and green herbs and dessert and wine , with candles burning and perfumes <unk> , and the three maidens , with their faces unveiled , said with one voice &apos; &apos; <unk> Allah , it is good ! &apos;
Then they turned to the porter and saw that he was <unk> and <unk> with drinking and dalliance .
So they took him for one of themselves and said , &apos; He is a Calender like ourselves , either an Arab or a foreigner . &apos;
When the porter heard this , he rose and <unk> his eyes on them , said , &apos; Sit still and do not meddle .
Have you not read what is written on the door ?
It befits not folk , like yourselves , who come to us as mendicants , to loose your tongues on us . &apos;
&apos;We ask pardon of God , O fakir ! &apos;
answered they .
&apos;Our heads are before thee . &apos;
The ladies laughed and making peace between them , set food before the Calenders .
When they had eaten , they all sat down again to carouse , the portress serving the new <unk> , and the cup passed round awhile , till the porter said to the Calenders , &apos; O brothers , have ye no story or rare <unk> to divert us withal ? &apos;
The Calenders , being warm with wine , called for musical instruments ; so the portress brought them a tambourine and a lute and a Persian harp ; and each Calender took one and tuned it and played and sang ; and the girls joined in lustily and made a great noise .
Whilst they were thus engaged , some one knocked at the gate and the portress rose and went to see who it was .
Now the cause of this knocking was that , that very night , the Khalif Haroun er Reshid had gone down into the City , as was his wont , every now and then , to walk about for his diversion and hear what news was <unk> , attended by his Vizier Jaafer and Mesrour his headsman , all three , as usual , disguised as merchants .
Their way brought them to the house of the three ladies , where they heard the noise of musical instruments and of singing and <unk> , and the Khalif said to Jaafer , &apos; I have a mind to enter this house and listen to this music and see the singers . &apos;
&apos;O Commander of the Faithful , &apos; answered Jaafer , &apos; these people are certainly drunk , and I fear lest some mischief betide us at their hands . &apos;
&apos;It matters not , &apos; rejoined the Khalif ; &apos; I must and will go in and I desire that thou contrive some <unk> to that end . &apos;
&apos;I hear and obey , &apos; replied the Vizier and going up to the gate , knocked , whereupon the portress came down and opened .
Jaafer came forward and kissing the earth before her , said , &apos; O lady , we are merchants from Tiberias : we reached Baghdad ten days ago and sold our merchandise and took up our lodging at the khan of the merchants .
Now we were bidden to-night to an entertainment at the house of a certain merchant , who set food before us and we ate and caroused with him awhile , till he gave us leave to depart and we went out , intending for our lodging ; but being strangers in Baghdad , we lost ourselves and could not find our way back to our khan : so we hope , of your courtesy , that you will admit us to pass the night with you , and God will requite you . &apos;
The portress looked at them and saw that they were dressed like merchants and appeared respectable ; so she returned to her sisters and repeated to them Jaafer &apos;s story , and they took compassion on the supposed strangers and bade her admit them .
So she resumed and opened the gate to them , and they said , &apos; Have we thy leave to enter ? &apos;
<unk> , &apos; answered she ; whereupon the Khalif and Jaafer and Mesrour entered ; and when the girls saw them , they rose and welcomed them and made them sit down and served them , saying , &apos; Ye are welcome as our guests , but on one condition . &apos;
&apos;What is that ? &apos;
asked they ; and the mistress of the house answered , &apos; It is that you be eyes without tongues and that , whatever you see , you enquire not thereof nor speak of that which concerns you not , lest you hear what will not please you . &apos;
&apos;Good , &apos; answered they : &apos; we are no <unk> . &apos;
Then they sat down to carouse ; whilst the Khalif looked at the three Calenders and marvelled for that they were all blind of the right eye , and gazed upon the ladies and was amazed at their beauty and goodliness .
They fell to drinking and talking and said to the Khalif , &apos; Drink . &apos;
But he answered , &apos; <unk> me , for I am vowed to the pilgrimage .
&apos; &#91; FN # 29 &#93; Whereupon the portress rose and spreading a gold-embroidered cloth before him , set thereon a china bowl , into which she poured willow-flower water , with a <unk> of snow and some <unk> sugar-candy .
The Khalif thanked her and said to himself , &apos; By Allah , I will reward her to-morrow for her kind office ! &apos;
Then they addressed themselves to <unk> , till the wine began to work upon them , when the eldest lady rose and making an obeisance to her guests , took the cateress by the hand and said , &apos; Come , sisters , let us do our duty . &apos;
And they answered , &apos; It is well . &apos;
So the portress rose and cleared the middle of the saloon , after she had removed the table service and thrown away the remains of the banquet .
Then she renewed the perfumes in the censers and made the Calenders sit down on a sofa by the dais and the Khalif and his companions on a sofa at the other end ; after which she called to the porter , saying , &apos; How dull and <unk> thou art !
Come and help us : thou art no stranger , but one of the household ! &apos;
So he rose and girt his middle and said , &apos; What would you have me do ? &apos;
And she answered , &apos; Stay where thou art . &apos;
Then the cateress rose and setting a chair in the middle of the room , went to a closet , which she opened , saying to the porter , &apos; Come and help me . &apos;
So he went to her and she brought out two black bitches , with chains round their necks , and gave them to him , saying , &apos; Take them . &apos;
So he took them and carried them to the middle of the saloon ; whereupon the mistress of the house tucked up her sleeves and taking a whip , said to the porter , &apos; Bring me one of the bitches . &apos;
So he brought it to her by the chain ; and the bitch wept and shook its head at the damsel , who brought the whip down on it , whilst the porter held it by the chain .
The bitch <unk> and <unk> , but the lady ceased not to beat it till her arm was tired ; when she threw away the whip and pressing the bitch to her bosom , kissed it on the head and wiped away its tears .
Then she said to the porter , &apos; Take it back and bring the other . &apos;
He did as she bade him , and she did with the second bitch as she had done with the first .
The Khalif &apos;s mind was troubled at her doings and his breast <unk> and he could not restrain his impatience to know the meaning of all this .
So he winked to Jaafer to ask , but the latter turned and signed to him as who should say , &apos; Be silent : this is no time for impertinent curiosity . &apos;
Then said the portress to the mistress of the house , &apos; O my lady , rise and go up to thy place , that I in turn may do my part . &apos;
&apos;It is well , &apos; answered she and went up and sat down on the couch of juniper-wood , at the upper end of the dais ; whilst the portress sat down on a chair and said to the cateress , &apos; Do what thou hast to do . &apos;
